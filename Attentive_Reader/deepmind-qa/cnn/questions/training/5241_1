on @entity7 before returning , in a rage over the death of @entity6 , @entity3 committed @entity4 sins ; he raped a betrothed young woman , he committed murder ( nimrod ) , he denied @entity1 , he denied the resurrection of the dead , and he spurned his birthright .

bless you : he wore his brother @entity3 's clothes to finagle his father @entity2 's blessing
