@entity7 chose the sonnet because the form can be divided into @entity8 parts ( @entity6 quatrains , @entity5 sestet ) similar to the form of meditation or spiritual exercise described by @entity2 in which ( @entity3 ) the penitent conjures up the scene of meditation before him ( 2 ) the penitent analyses , seeking to glean and then embrace whatever truths it may contain ; and ( @entity9 ) after analysis , the penitent is ready to address god in a form of petition or resign himself to divine will that the meditation reveals .
