a dream matchup on paper ( including white vs. @ent9 , which was to be the @ent11 time @ent13 @ent12 winners would play against each other ) , @ent1 turned out to be a rout , as @ent9 threw for @ent3 touchdown passes on 18-for-35 passing and @ent2 to lead the @ent10 to a 55â€“19 victory .

@ent8 : @ent7 , @ent4 & @ent5 are a few of this school 's recent winners
