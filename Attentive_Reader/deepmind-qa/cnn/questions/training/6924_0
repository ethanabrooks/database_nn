@entity3 borrowed heavily from both , but expanded the plot by developing a number of supporting characters , particularly @entity1 and @entity4 .

fun on the map : this world capital has the same name as a character in " @entity2 "

@entity4

@entity0:
@entity1:Mercutio
@entity2:Romeo and Juliet
@entity3:Shakespeare
@entity4:Paris
