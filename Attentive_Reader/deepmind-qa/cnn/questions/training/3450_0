  the stage version included many songs by @ent2 , most of which were left out of the film , " @ent1 " being the only exception .

i love a show tune : he wrote the song from " @ent3 " that says , " night and day , you are the one "

@ent2

@ent0:
@ent1:Night and Day
@ent2:Cole Porter
@ent3:The Gay Divorcee
