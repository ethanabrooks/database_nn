@ent1 described this album as " the sound of ... .electric guitars in an abandoned yet fully furnished tiki bar in @ent2 @ent9 . " [ ]   @ent6 's wife talked him into letting her send @ent8 , who is her sister , a demo of his song " @ent5 , " which was reworked and recorded as " do n't tell me " ( from @ent8 's @ent7 album @ent3 ) .

music makers : a song by @ent4 , heard here , became a hit recording by this sister - in-law of his"don't tell me to stop /tell the rain not to drop /tell the wind not to blow ... "
