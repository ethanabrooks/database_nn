there are @entity3 major reasons why the scarcity principle works : when things are difficult to get , they are usually more valuable so that can make it seem to have better quality ; and when things become less available , we could lose the chance to acquire them .

so you want to be a 19th century heroine : even if you 're @entity4 & still single , like @entity2 in this author 's " @entity5 " , your life may not be over
