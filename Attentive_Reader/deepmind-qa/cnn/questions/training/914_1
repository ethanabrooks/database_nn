( the opening credits to wine , women & war exhibit revisionism , establishing that it was @ent6 , not @ent1 , who authorized the operation to turn @ent8 into a cyborg . )   @ent3 's portrayal of @ent6 was that of a warm , fatherly figureâ€”though he could also be a calculating bureaucrat when the need arose .

if the tv series had a downer ending : @ent5 kills the o.s.i. program ; @ent2 is directed to recycle title gal @ent4 for spare parts
