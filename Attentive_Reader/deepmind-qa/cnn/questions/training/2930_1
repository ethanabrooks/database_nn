it is irrelevant from a @entity8 point of view that the hebrew bible identifies the temple mount in @entity10 as @entity3 , as early in the biblical narrative as the chapter dedicated to the construction of @entity5 in the book of @entity7 ( see ) , around @entity9 predating @entity1 's account .

@entity2 : ( alex stands at @entity4 in @entity10 . ) the western wall is the only remnant of a retaining wall that was built to support @entity11 ; now tradition says this mount was @entity12 , the site where this patriarch prepared to sacrifice his son
