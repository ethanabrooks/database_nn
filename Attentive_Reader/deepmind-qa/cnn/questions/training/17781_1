the date of @entity11 may have initially been chosen to correspond with the day exactly @entity7 after @entity1 on which early @entity8 believed that @entity9 was conceived , or with @entity5 or more ancient polytheistic festivals that occurred near southern solstice ( i.e. , the @entity13 winter solstice ) ; a further solar connection has been suggested because of a biblical verse identifying @entity9 as the " sun of righteousness".newton , @entity12 , @entity4 on the prophecies of @entity3 , and the apocalypse of st. john ( 1733 ) .
