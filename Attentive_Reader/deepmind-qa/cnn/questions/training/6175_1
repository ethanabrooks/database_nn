i can see the possibility of @entity2 being an acceptable adjective for something associated with the government , as are the examples you gave .

the american revolution : this country 's fleet blocked the entrance to @entity3 , allowing an @entity4 victory at @entity5

@entity0

@entity0:
@entity1:France
@entity2:United States
@entity3:Chesapeake Bay
@entity4:American
@entity5:Yorktown
