@entity6 and @entity10 , as it is learned when @entity6 visits @entity10 in the " archie 's brother " episode , had not seen each other in @entity4 since @entity10 and @entity7 's wedding , although they apparently had communicated over @entity9 via phone ( @entity3 early episodes -- " cousin oscar " and " @entity5 " -- depict phone conversations between @entity10 and fred ) , their long estrangement fueled because of a petty argument , apparently out of a sibling rivalry of sorts going back to their childhood .
