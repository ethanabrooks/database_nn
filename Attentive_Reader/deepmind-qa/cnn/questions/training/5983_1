@ent7 own account of how he invented the popular " @ent5 " ( and its " adoption " marketing success , described below ) is contradicted by numerous published references alleging that mr. @ent6 essentially copied the entire physical appearance of his dolls , copied the " adopt a baby " marketing innovation and other intellectual property belonging to a rural @ent4 lady , @ent9 thomas ; with whom mr. @ent6 had a prior documented relationship before introducing his own dolls .
