@entity11 sired several children by @entity12 : @entity10 , @entity8 , @entity9 , hades , and @entity7 , but swallowed them all as soon as they were born , since he had learned from @entity4 and @entity2 that he was destined to be overthrown by his son as he had previously overthrown @entity2 , his own father , an oracle that @entity12 heard and wished to avert .

it 's greek myth to me : @entity1 says the @entity6 equivalents of the vedic male trinity of @entity3 , varuna & indra are @entity5 , hades & him
