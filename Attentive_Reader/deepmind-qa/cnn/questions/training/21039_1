nocturnes are generally thought of as being tranquil , often expressive and lyrical , and sometimes rather gloomy , but in practice pieces with the name nocturne have conveyed a variety of moods : the second of @entity5 's orchestral @entity3 , " fêtes " , for example , is very lively , as are parts of @entity7 @entity6 ( @entity1 ) and kaikhosru shapurji sorabji 's symphonic nocturne for piano alone ( 1977–78 ) .

paintings : his " @entity4 , black and gold--the falling rocket " is n't quite as well known as that painting of his mother
