  in the tanakh   some examples from the book of @ent3 , which have been frequently recited and memorized by @ent1 for centuries , state :    " by the rivers of @ent4 , there we sat down , yea , we wept , when we remembered @ent2 . " ( psalm 137:1 )   " for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song ; and they that wasted us required of us mirth , saying , sing us one of the songs of @ent2 .

geographic quotations : psalm 137 says " by the rivers of " this place " we sat down ... we wept when we remembered @ent5 "
