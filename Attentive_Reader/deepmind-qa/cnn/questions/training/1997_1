after the film 's release , the careers of each man took different arcs : mifune continued to enjoy success with a range of samurai and war - themed films ( rebellion , samurai assassin , the emperor and a general , among others ) .

classic foreign films : @ent2 starred in this director 's epic " throne of blood " , sort of a samurai version of " @ent1 "
