@entity6 was best known for her appearances as a panelist on the 1970s @entity3 game show @entity8 ( during her tenure she sat in the top center seat next to @entity5 , who joined as a regular around the same time and occupied the top right seat ) , although her debut episode had her sitting in the bottom - left position .
