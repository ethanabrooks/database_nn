filming frances ( @entity6 ) , which co - starred @entity7 and @entity2 , was a grueling experience for @entity3 , who pored over the screenplay scene by scene , making deep and often taxing connections between her life and @entity1 's in order to tap into the well of emotions the role required .

what i really want to do is direct : this playwright gave @entity5 a big role when he directed the film " @entity4 " ; maybe he 's a " fool for love "

@entity2

@entity0:
@entity1:Farmer
@entity2:Sam Shepard
@entity3:Lange
@entity4:Far North
@entity5:Jessica Lange
@entity6:1982
@entity7:Kim Stanley
