  another notable character in the book is @entity7 , a wannabe @entity1 gangster , who tries to bully @entity4 into being friends and whose career advice to @entity4 , focused solely on commercial interests , is the opposite of the advice @entity4 was once given by his old mentor , @entity3 , who valued artistic integrity above all other concerns .
