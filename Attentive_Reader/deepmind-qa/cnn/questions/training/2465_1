the current department of @entity5 , however , does not have only @entity4 climate , the complex terrain and high mountains divide the department between those who are well exposed ( the south - facing side ) and those which are less ( the north - facing side ) and even with the mild @entity1 climate there can be violent storms and prolonged droughts .

smaller than albuquerque : this principality is surrounded by the @entity2 department of @entity5
