@entity2 , the @entity7 presidential nominee of the u.s. greens , campaigned with ultra - conservative @entity6 on joint issues such as farm policy and bans on corporate funding of election campaigns , although this " alliance " between @entity4 and @entity3 was very specifically limited to the purpose of showing that there was broad support for certain specific issues , across the political spectrum .

@entity1 : a joke had it that this @entity8 nominee was furious at @entity5 for ruining his chance at the presidency
