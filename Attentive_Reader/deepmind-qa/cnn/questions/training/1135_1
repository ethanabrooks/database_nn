the @entity1 @entity2 review described it as a " funny , sardonic little memoir " , but " pretty slight , padded out with big type , extra space between the lines and some family photographs , and it displays at times an almost antic need to entertain .

nonfiction : this actress ' memoir " @entity5 " talks about coming of age on the set of " @entity4 "
