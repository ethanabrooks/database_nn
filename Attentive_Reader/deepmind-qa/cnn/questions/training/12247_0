exfoliation ( caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface ) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as @entity1 and @entity1 and inset arches like @entity4 .

i'm bored ! : take a hike ! up this impressive 8,800-foot formation in @entity2

@entity1

@entity0:
@entity1:Half Dome
@entity2:Yosemite National Park
@entity3:North Dome
@entity4:Royal Arches
