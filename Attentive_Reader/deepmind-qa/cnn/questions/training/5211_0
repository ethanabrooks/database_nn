in the @ent2 game , on the last meaningful play of the game , @ent8 missed an assignment of blocking linebacker @ent7 , which resulted in @ent1 nearly being sacked by @ent6 and as a result throwing a desperation pass into the end zone that was intercepted by @ent5 .

the @ent3 cowboys : this " dandy " guy still holds the team record for longest pass completion , a 95-yarder to @ent4 in @ent2
