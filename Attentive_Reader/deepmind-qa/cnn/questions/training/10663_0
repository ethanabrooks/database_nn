in the tanakh   some examples from the book of @entity3 , which have been frequently recited and memorized by @entity1 for centuries , state :    " by the rivers of @entity4 , there we sat down , yea , we wept , when we remembered @entity5 . " ( psalm 137:1 )   " for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song ; and they that wasted us required of us mirth , saying , sing us one of the songs of @entity5 .
