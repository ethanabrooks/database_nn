@entity2 ' vision of a " used future " was further popularized in the science fiction - horror films @entity6 , which was set on a dirty space freighter ; @entity3 , which is set in a post - apocalyptic desert ; and blade runner , which is set in a crumbling , dirty city of the future .

missed it by that much ... : @entity1 was the hero of my script " store wars " , a better tale than this director 's " @entity4 " movie
