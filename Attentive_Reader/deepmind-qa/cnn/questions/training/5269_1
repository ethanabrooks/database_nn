now i want             spirits to enforce , art to enchant ,             and my ending is despair ,             unless i be relieved by prayer ,             which pierces so that it assaults @entity2 itself and frees all faults .

fairies : this fairy in " @entity4 " serves the magician @entity3 without " grudge or grumblings "

@entity0:
@entity1:Ariel
@entity2:           Mercy
