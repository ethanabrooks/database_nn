in the @entity2 game , on the last meaningful play of the game , @entity3 missed an assignment of blocking linebacker @entity4 , which resulted in @entity7 nearly being sacked by @entity5 and as a result throwing a desperation pass into the end zone that was intercepted by @entity1 .

the @entity8 cowboys : this " dandy " guy still holds the team record for longest pass completion , a 95-yarder to @entity6 in @entity2
