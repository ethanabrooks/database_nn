@entity6 had worked as a janitor , and @entity5 as a housekeeper ( in @entity3 episode , as @entity5 says that the building 's white janitor was properly referred to as a " custodian " , @entity6 says : " well , whenever a man of our race has that job , he is a janitor ! " ) .

i think i missed that movie : filmed in @entity4 , but not released until @entity7 , " ghost fever " starred this man , tv 's @entity2
