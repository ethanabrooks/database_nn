very little remains of the castle , which would originally have belonged to the @entity1 family but became a royal castle with the earls of argyll ( campbells ) as hereditary keepers , paying a nominal rent of a single red rose to the sovereign .

on a map , somewhere : @entity3 , a burgh on the coast of this country , has a famous statue of " highland mary "
