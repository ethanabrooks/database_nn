in the @entity6 game , on the last meaningful play of the game , @entity1 missed an assignment of blocking linebacker @entity4 , which resulted in @entity2 nearly being sacked by @entity7 and as a result throwing a desperation pass into the end zone that was intercepted by @entity5 .

the @entity3 cowboys : this " dandy " guy still holds the team record for longest pass completion , a 95-yarder to @entity8 in @entity6
