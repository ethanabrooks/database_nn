the play sets its context with an epigram ( not to be recited in performance ) by @entity6 , from his novel @entity5 , contained in a frontispiece : it starts : " which is the most reasonable , and does his duty best : he who stands aloof from the struggle of life , calmly contemplating it , or he who descends to the ground , and takes his part in the contest ? " the character of @entity3 finds himself on both sides of this dilemma , and at times in the play he " stands aloof , " and at other times he " takes part " in life 's contest , with its moral strictures .

well , it 's not shakespeare : last name of @entity1 , the screenwriter who wrote " @entity4 " , a play about greedy producers
