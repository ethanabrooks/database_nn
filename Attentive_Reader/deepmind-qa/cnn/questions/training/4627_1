  legacy button 's autograph is highly sought by collectors as a result of a combination of the desire by many top collectors to acquire a complete set of autographs by all @ent2 signers of the u.s. declaration of independence , and the extreme rarity of the gwinnett signature ; there are @ent1 known examples , since @ent6 was fairly obscure prior to signing the declaration and died shortly afterward .

@ent5 revolutionaries : @ent7 is best remembered for his signature on this document ( & an autograph that later sold for $ @ent3 )
