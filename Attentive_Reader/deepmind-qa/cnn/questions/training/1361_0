@entity1 bears traits common with @entity4 solar goddesses , such as the possession of a mirror and the invention of weaving ( for instance , the baltic saule possesses both these characteristics ) , and her association with @entity2 ( herself also suspected of being the remnants of a solar goddess ) adds solar iconography to her cultus .

greek mythology : for daring to compare herself to @entity1 , this @entity3 maiden was changed into a monster
