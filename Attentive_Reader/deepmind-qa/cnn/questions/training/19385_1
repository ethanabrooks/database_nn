an independent laboratory eventually confirmed that the failure of the glass was due to oscillations and repeated thermal stresses caused by the expansion and contraction of the air between the inner and outer glass panels which formed each window ; the resilient bonding between the inner glass , reflective material , and outer glass was so stiff that it was transmitting the force to the outer glass ( instead of absorbing it ) , thus causing the glass to fail .
