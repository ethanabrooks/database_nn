just as both climate and relief are variable across the region , so too is vegetation also extremely variable , with sparse tundra in the north and high mountains , boreal forest on the north - eastern and central regions temperate coniferous forests ( formerly of which a majority was in the @entity3 highlands and south west @entity4 ) and temperate broadleaf forests growing in the south , west and temperate east .

on the risk board : if you go north from the risk territory of @entity1 , you get to this peninsular territory
