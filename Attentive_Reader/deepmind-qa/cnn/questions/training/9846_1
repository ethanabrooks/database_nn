roberts own account of how he invented the popular " @entity4 " ( and its " adoption " marketing success , described below ) is contradicted by numerous published references alleging that mr. @entity7 essentially copied the entire physical appearance of his dolls , copied the " adopt a baby " marketing innovation and other intellectual property belonging to a rural @entity3 lady , @entity8 thomas ; with whom mr. @entity7 had a prior documented relationship before introducing his own dolls .
