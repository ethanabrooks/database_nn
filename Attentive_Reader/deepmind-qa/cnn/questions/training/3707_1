both lewises were staples of vintage @ent6 radio ; radio historians @ent2 and @ent10 have written of their numerous , genre - spanning works in comedy and drama ( they were , for example , regulars among what was known as @ent7 's @ent4 group of performers , appearing often---together and separately---on such programs as the whistler ) , especially their co - creation of the respected anthology series on stage and their stewardship ( with @ent1 directing and both of the couple acting ) of the venerable mystery series @ent9 .

entertainment history : @ent1 was this title character paired with @ent5 on a ' 50s tv show based on a hit radio show
