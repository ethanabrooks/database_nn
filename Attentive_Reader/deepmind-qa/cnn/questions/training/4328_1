@ent10 supported his arguments by numerous correspondences between @ent1 accounts and his own observations :   the river " @ent2 " divides the empire into @ent14 halves , with @ent12 provinces ( " kingdoms " ) south of the river and @ent11 to the north ; @ent6 " @ent13 " was just south of " @ent5 " , and @ent10 learned that there was no other country between @ent8 and " @ent5 " ( i.e. , the lands of @ent3 and @ent4 ) .

geography : the northern part of this country was once called " @ent7 " or " @ent13 "
