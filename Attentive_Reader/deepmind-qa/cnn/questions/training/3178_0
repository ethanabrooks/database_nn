  the stage version included many songs by @entity3 , most of which were left out of the film , " @entity1 " being the only exception .

i love a show tune : he wrote the song from " @entity2 " that says , " night and day , you are the one "

@entity3

@entity0:
@entity1:Night and Day
@entity2:The Gay Divorcee
@entity3:Cole Porter
