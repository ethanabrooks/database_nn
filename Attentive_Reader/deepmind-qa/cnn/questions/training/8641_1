there are several hypotheses for its origin ; the most widely accepted explanation is that the moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between @entity2 and a @entity5 - sized body called @entity6 .

name the year : definitely a " giant leap " taken @entity4 when the photo seen here was shot ( astronaut about to touch @entity3 's surface )

@entity0

@entity0:
