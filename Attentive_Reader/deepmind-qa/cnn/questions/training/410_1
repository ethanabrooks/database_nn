though @entity4 is its prisoner and it can forcibly impregnate her , @entity3 uses different forms of persuasion – threatening a young girl that @entity4 is treating as a child psychologist ; reminding @entity4 of her young daughter , now dead ; displaying images of distant galaxies ; using electrodes to access her amygdala – because the computer needs @entity4 to love the child she will bear .
