pleased with the preference of @entity5 , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned .

@entity6 's digest : the @entity3 edition of her novel " @entity4 " was simply credited to " @entity2 "
