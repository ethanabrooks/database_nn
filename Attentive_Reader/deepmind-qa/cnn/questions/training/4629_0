to escape persecution , @entity6 sent some followers to @entity4 before he and his followers migrated from @entity7 to @entity1 ( then known as @entity2 ) in @entity8 .

seems like long ago : in @entity3 @entity5 besieged this city , but new resident @entity6 & his followers saved the day by digging a trench

@entity1

@entity0:
@entity1:Medina
@entity2:Yathrib
@entity3:627
@entity4:Abyssinia
@entity5:Meccans
@entity6:Muhammad
