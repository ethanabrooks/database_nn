in this migration , @entity1 was a barrier to further migration directly west or to the northwest , so first the pre - cypriots and then other groups of pre - hellenics turned south with the pre - cypriots continuing south to @entity3 and ultimately @entity4 , while the other groups crossed the @entity2 .

folklore : both laocoon & cassandra warned this city to refuse the big gift from the @entity5 , but did they listen ?

@entity0:
@entity1:Troy
