i could accept " @entity3 is a united states president " but " @entity6 is a @entity4 actress " still looks ridiculous to me .

birthplaces : the only @entity5 president born in @entity2 , @entity1

@entity3

@entity0:
@entity1:Massachusetts
@entity2:Milton
@entity3:George Bush
@entity4:United States
@entity5:U.S.
@entity6:Julia Roberts
