corregidor comes from the @ent2 word corregir , meaning " to correct . " @ent5 story states that the island was called isla del corregidor ( literally , island of the corrector ) due to the @ent2 customs system , wherein all ships entering @ent6 were required to stop and have their documents checked and " corrected " .
