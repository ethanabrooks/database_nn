the song , released during @entity2 , is not explicit in its criticism of that war in particular , but the clear attacks on the elite classes ( the families that give birth to " fortunate sons " ) of america and their withdrawal from the costs of nationalistic imperialism are easy to contextualize to that conflict .

@entity2

@entity0:
@entity1:Fortunate Son
@entity2:the Vietnam War
@entity3:The Green Berets
