the @entity2 film , @entity6 , starring @entity10 and @entity8 , portrayed @entity1 as a hero on a national scale , leading the oppressed saxons in revolt against their @entity5 overlords while @entity9 the @entity7 fought in the crusades ; this movie established itself so definitively that many studios resorted to movies about his son ( invented for that purpose ) rather than compete with the image of this one .

movie stars : this " @entity4 devil " played @entity11 but was perhaps most perfectly cast as @entity3
