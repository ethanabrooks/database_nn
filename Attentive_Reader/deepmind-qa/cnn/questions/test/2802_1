since @entity2 is a known law enforcement official and @entity1 is deep undercover , @entity2 will often have @entity1 arrested on a trumped - up charge so that he can talk to @entity1 without revealing his identity ( as he did in the @entity4 episode ; @entity5 was the reason @entity1 was locked up and he was not happy that @entity5 did not spring him before the sentence was completed ) .

from tv to film : in the ' 80s he was the villainous @entity8 on " @entity9 " ; in @entity6 he was the super - villainous @entity3
