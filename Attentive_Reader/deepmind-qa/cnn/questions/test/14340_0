any month that starts on a @entity3 contains a friday the 13th , and there is @entity5 @entity2 in every calendar year .

this is gonna be tough : months that contain a @entity2 will always begin on @entity4 of @entity1

@entity3

@entity0:
@entity1:the week
@entity2:Friday the 13th
@entity3:Sunday
@entity4:this day
@entity5:at least one
