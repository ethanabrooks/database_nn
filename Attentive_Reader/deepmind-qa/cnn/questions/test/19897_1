in most but not all modern states the constitution has supremacy over ordinary statutory law ( see @entity2 constitution below ) ; in such states when an official act is unconstitutional , i.e. it is not a power granted to the government by the constitution , that act is null and void , and the nullification is ab initio , that is , from inception , not from the date of the finding .

getting testy : for the @entity3 citizenship test , you should know things like the @entity5 was written in @entity1

@entity0

@entity0:
@entity1:this year
@entity2:Uncodified
@entity3:U.S.
@entity4:1787
@entity5:Constitution
