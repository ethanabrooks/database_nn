i know most " us"ers would disagree , but i 've always felt that it was presumptuous of us to call ourseleves @entity2 as if people from @entity4 and @entity5 , etc . were not .

@entity3 imports : for peat 's sake , @entity1 of the peat imported by the @entity3 comes from this neighbor

@entity4

@entity0:
@entity1:99%
@entity2:Americans
@entity3:U.S.
@entity4:Canada
@entity5:Mexico
