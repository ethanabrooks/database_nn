i use these books not for the usual purpose of naming babies ... but for naming characters in my fiction " ( @entity3 , @entity2 )    @entity7 commonly states that he originally intended for @entity8 to be a trilogy , and after the wild success of the @entity4 @entity5 books decided to expand the series to @entity1 books .

my fantasy writer team : @entity8 is a land created by this writer , & if you say his first & last name you 'll hear " @entity8 " in the middle

@entity0

@entity0:
@entity1:nine
@entity2:213
@entity3:Piers
@entity4:first
@entity5:three
@entity6:Piers Anthony
@entity7:Anthony
@entity8:Xanth
