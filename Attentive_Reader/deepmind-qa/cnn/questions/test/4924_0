the house of mirth ( @entity4 ) , by @entity7 , is the story of @entity3 , a well - born , but penniless woman of the high society of @entity5 , who was raised and educated to become wife to a rich man , a hothouse flower for conspicuous consumption .

@entity8 ' favorite books : ( @entity2 presents the clue . )   as in " @entity6 " , this author depicts a struggle with the @entity9 social order in " @entity1 " , & i think even more powerfully
