  gorgons were a popular image in @entity7 mythology , appearing in the earliest of written records of ancient greek religious beliefs such as those of @entity4 , which may date to as early as 1194â€“1184 bc. because of their legendary and powerful gaze that could turn @entity3 to stone , images of the @entity6 were put upon objects and buildings for protection .

it 's greek myth to me : @entity1 proved this @entity5 was n't immortal
