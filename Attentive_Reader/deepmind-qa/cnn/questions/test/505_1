@entity4 argues that " @entity7 " was a name given to @entity1 because her deeds were as beautiful as incense ( hence : ketores ) , and/or that she remained chaste from the time she was separated from abraham—keturah [ קְטוּרָה q'turah ] derives from @entity3 word for restrained .

the bible : while barren , she gave her @entity5 maid @entity1 to @entity6 to bear his children
