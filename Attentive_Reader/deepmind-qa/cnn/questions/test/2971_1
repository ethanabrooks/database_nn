  in modern - day productions , @ent1 and the @ent4 are typically played by different singers ( unless limited by such things as finance or rehearsal time and space ) , although the same singer played both roles in both the @ent6 and @ent3 premieres , and the final scene 's chorus of demons after the @ent4 's exit gives the singer time for a costume change before entering as @ent1 for the sextet .

@ent7 museums : a @ent6 museum devoted to this composer contains the rooms where he finished " @ent5 "
