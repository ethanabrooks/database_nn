these are words that are spelled differently from in @entity2 but are derivable from a @entity2 prototype by phonological rules ( e.g. sanskrit karma , " deed " becomes pali kamma , and eventually hindi kƒÅm , " work " ) .

word origins : the name of this dialect comes from a @entity3 word , mantri , meaning " counselor "
