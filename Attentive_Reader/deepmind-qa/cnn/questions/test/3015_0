@ent1 major military battles took place near the city : in @ent11 , the battle of poitiers ( also known as the battle of tours ) , in which the @ent9 commanded by @ent2 halted the expansion of the umayyad caliphate , and in @ent5 , @ent10 , a key victory for the @ent7 forces during @ent3 .

frankly : this frankish king earned his byname " the hammer " by beating back the @ent8 invasion of @ent4 at @ent6 in @ent11
