although @entity1 became a performer , he was hired on a @entity3 writer contract , and refused to sign the performer contract that was repeatedly given to him , allowing him to leave the show after the @entity4 season in @entity5 .

@entity2 : this late , great comedian gave us the memorable " anal - retentive chef " & " unfrozen caveman lawyer "
