@entity1 bears traits common with @entity3 solar goddesses , such as the possession of a mirror and the invention of weaving ( for instance , the baltic saule possesses both these characteristics ) , and her association with @entity2 ( herself also suspected of being the remnants of a solar goddess ) adds solar iconography to her cultus .

mythology : @entity1 gave this maiden snaky hair & a face so hideous that a glimpse of it would turn men to stone
