but @entity7 knew the rules better than anyone else in the park , it turned out , for he went down quickly to the clubhouse and pointed out to the umpires that a game that was not yet an official game and hence could not be treated as suspended game ( i.e. , it had not gone @entity3 , or @entity1 with the home team leading , as neither was the case ) , and as such had to be replayed from the first pitch ( as was then the rule in a rainout ) .

in the big inning : in @entity6 game , a play by shortstop @entity2 ended this @entity8 's @entity4 hitting streak
