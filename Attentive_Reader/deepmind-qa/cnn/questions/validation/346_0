i could accept " @entity3 is a united states president " but " @entity6 is a @entity4 actress " still looks ridiculous to me .

oops ! : in @entity1 the rcmp & the secret service had to rescue this former @entity5 president from a @entity2 peat bog

@entity3

@entity0:
@entity1:July 1995
@entity2:Canadian
@entity3:George Bush
@entity4:United States
@entity5:U.S.
@entity6:Julia Roberts
