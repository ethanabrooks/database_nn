@entity1 bears traits common with @entity4 solar goddesses , such as the possession of a mirror and the invention of weaving ( for instance , the baltic saule possesses both these characteristics ) , and her association with @entity2 ( herself also suspected of being the remnants of a solar goddess ) adds solar iconography to her cultus .

@entity3 mistakes : she foolishly fooled around with @entity5 in @entity1 's temple , so @entity1 turned her hair into snakes

@entity2

@entity0:
@entity1:Athena
@entity2:Medusa
@entity3:MYTHOLOGICAL
@entity4:Indo-European
@entity5:Poseidon
