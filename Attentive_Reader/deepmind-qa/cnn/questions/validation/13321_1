conflicts with @entity3 @entity5 and marriage to @entity4 ( 1954â€“55 )   although @entity7 had become one of 20th century - @entity5 's biggest stars , her contract had not changed since @entity2 , meaning that she was paid far less than other stars of her stature and could not choose her projects or co - workers .

& other fancy stuff : @entity6 described this actor who died in @entity1 as " the only person i know who is in worse shape than i am "
