  according to the commentary by directors @entity5 and @entity6 on the dvd , many elements from the book , such as @entity7 ' childhood and his other marriages ( the film focuses only on his marriage to @entity3 ) , were dropped because they felt it did not move the story along .

readers : @entity4 is all ears for " @entity1 " by this producer & ex - husband of @entity3
