i use these books not for the usual purpose of naming babies ... but for naming characters in my fiction " ( @ent4 , @ent8 )    @ent2 commonly states that he originally intended for @ent5 to be a trilogy , and after the wild success of the @ent3 @ent1 books decided to expand the series to @ent6 books .

my fantasy writer team : @ent5 is a land created by this writer , & if you say his first & last name you 'll hear " @ent5 " in the middle
