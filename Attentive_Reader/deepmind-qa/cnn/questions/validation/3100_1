  another notable character in the book is @ent3 , a wannabe @ent2 gangster , who tries to bully @ent6 into being friends and whose career advice to @ent6 , focused solely on commercial interests , is the opposite of the advice @ent6 was once given by his old mentor , @ent7 , who valued artistic integrity above all other concerns .
