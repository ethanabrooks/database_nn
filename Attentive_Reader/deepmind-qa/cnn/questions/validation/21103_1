@entity6 ( @entity1 ) is an aspiring ice hockey player who possesses a powerful and dangerous slapshot that his father ( @entity3 ) taught him as a child ( @entity2 ) before he was apparently struck and killed by a wayward hockey puck , though his over aggressive streak ( which once resulted in him trying to stab a guy to death with an ice skate ) and lack of skating talent consistently preclude him from joining a hockey team .
