however , early appearances of the name as šēgal or šāgal in @entity4 inscriptions suggest these are folk etymologies and its ultimately derivation is as a loanword from the @entity3 title 𒊩𒂍𒃲 issu ēkalli > ( is)sēkalli " queen " ( literally " palace woman " ) , borrowed from @entity2 into @entity5 and @entity8 as the divine and personal name שֵׁגַ֥ל , including in the hebrew bible ( e.g. psalm 45:9 ) .
