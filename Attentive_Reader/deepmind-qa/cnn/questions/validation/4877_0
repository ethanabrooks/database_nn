i had understood that @entity3 usage of " @entity5 "   meant the @entity6 uniquely , and would be surprised to find a londoner in @entity7 thinking he 'd " come to @entity5 " , but perhaps i stand to be corrected there .

sports firsts : the @entity1 baseball @entity2 game played outside the @entity6 was played in this city in @entity4

@entity7

@entity0:
@entity1:first
@entity2:World Series
@entity3:U.K.
@entity4:1992
@entity5:America
@entity6:U.S.
@entity7:Toronto
