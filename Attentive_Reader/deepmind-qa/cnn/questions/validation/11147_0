@entity1 bears traits common with @entity3 solar goddesses , such as the possession of a mirror and the invention of weaving ( for instance , the baltic saule possesses both these characteristics ) , and her association with @entity2 ( herself also suspected of being the remnants of a solar goddess ) adds solar iconography to her cultus .

the feminine mistake : this lady of myth boasted of her beauty to @entity1 , who was a teensy bit jealous & gave her a monster makeover

@entity2

@entity0:
@entity1:Athena
@entity2:Medusa
@entity3:Indo-European
