bullwinkle was featured in @entity1 ; being his usual likably klutzy self ; the tag line at @entity6 being " go with cheerios ! " followed by @entity4 , usually worse for wear due to his @entity5 - inspired bravery somewhat backfiring , saying " ... but watch where you 're going ! "

they own that ? : cheer is owned by @entity3 ; @entity5 is owned by this company
