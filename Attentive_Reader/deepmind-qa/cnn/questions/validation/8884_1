@entity5 awarded it an average @entity6 stars ( out of a possible @entity4 ) finding some of @entity7 ' satire effective but feeling that @entity3 decision to portray her character 's mental illness with realism instead of in a campy fashion , while brave , made the character difficult to laugh at , writing , " @entity2 closely and you 'll realize that something is miscalculated at a fundamental level .

tv stars on film : she already had her own talk show when she played @entity3 daughter in " @entity1 "
