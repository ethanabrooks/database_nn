certain historically religious cities such as @entity3 and @entity1 among others will schedule games no earlier than 1:35 pm to ensure time for people who go to religious service in the morning can get to the game in time .

a side of beans : puritan women in this city baked beans on @entity4 & served them for @entity5 dinner , thus the nickname " @entity2 "

@entity3

@entity0:
