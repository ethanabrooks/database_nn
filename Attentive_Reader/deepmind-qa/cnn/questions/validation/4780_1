it was ultimately decided that @ent2 , who was of college age , would be spun off and have a white roommate in order to show the dynamic of a white girl in predominantly - black surroundings .

tv spin - offs : " facts of life " came from " diff'rent strokes " , & " @ent1 " came from his series

@ent0

@ent0:
@ent1:A Different World
@ent2:Denise
@ent3:Bill Cosby
