the story of @entity7 seems to rework legends associated with the @entity5 clan , and its function was to establish that clan 's links to the ruling family , just as those of @entity6 arguably reflect @entity1 tales and the legends in @entity2 's chronicles seem to derive from @entity8 clan traditions .

chronicles : you 'll find the deeds of @entity4 in the " nihon shoki " , or " chronicle of " this country
