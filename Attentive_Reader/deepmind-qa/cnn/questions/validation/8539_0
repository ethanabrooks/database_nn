the letter was addressed to " my @entity3 ... " , but as the term " @entity6 " ( appearing only once towards the end of the letter ) was unique in @entity2 's vocabulary , it has been used ever since . of a love letter which composer @entity5 wrote on @entity7 in @entity1 .

classical composers : many think that @entity4 was the recipient of his " @entity6 " letter
