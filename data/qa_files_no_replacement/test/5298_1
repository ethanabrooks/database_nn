  marin 's nickname " cheech " is short for " chicharron " , a fried pork skin that is a popular snack in mexican cuisine and a favorite of marijuana smokers afflicted with " the munchies " , and the nickname 's alliteration with chong 's surname made " cheech and chong " an obvious choice for the name of the duo .
