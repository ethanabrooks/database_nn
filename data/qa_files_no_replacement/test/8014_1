  gorgons were a popular image in greek mythology , appearing in the earliest of written records of ancient greek religious beliefs such as those of homer , which may date to as early as 1194â€“1184 bc. because of their legendary and powerful gaze that could turn one to stone , images of the gorgons were put upon objects and buildings for protection .
