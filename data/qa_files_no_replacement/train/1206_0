the city has been an urban centre , first under the etruscans ( velzna/felsina ) and the celts ( bona ) , then under the romans ( bononia ) , then again in the middle ages , as a free municipality ( for one century it was the fifth largest european city based on population ) .

my bologna : bologna was originally called felsina by this group who predated the romans

the etruscans
