with arthur sullivan and then edward german , he wrote several well - received pieces for the savoy theatre , including the rose of persia ( 1899 ) , the emerald isle ( 1901 ) , merrie england ( 1902 ) and a princess of kensington ( 1903 ) .

without my partner : he composed the operetta " the rose of persia " to a libretto by basil hood , not gilbert
