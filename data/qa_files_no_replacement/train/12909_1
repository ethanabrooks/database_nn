don rich was the sparkling country guitar player in buck owens 's " the buckaroos " band of the 1960s , but besides rich 's style , both garcia 's pedal steel guitar playing ( on grateful dead records and others ) and his standard electric guitar work , were influenced by another of owens 's buckaroos of that time , pedal steel player tom brumley .

last but not least : this band gave its last concert with jerry garcia at chicago 's soldier field in 1995
