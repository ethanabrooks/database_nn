  wi ' mony a vow , and lock'd embrace , our parting was fu ' tender ; and , pledging aft to meet again , we tore oursel 's asunder ; but , oh ! fell death 's untimely frost , that nipt my flower sae early ! - now green 's the sod , and cauld 's the clay , that wraps my highland mary !

poetry : the poem " highland mary " is inscribed on the scroll at his statue 's feet in central park 's literary walk
