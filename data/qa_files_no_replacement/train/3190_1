  the text prithviraj raso , by chanda baradai , about the 1192 ce defeat of prithviraj chauhan at the hands of muhammad ghori , is full of references to " hindus " and " turks " , and at one stage , says " both the religions have drawn their curved swords ; " however , the date of this text is unclear and considered by most scholars to be more recent .

oh my gods ! : in hindu myth , kama , armed with a bow of sugarcane & flower - tipped arrows , is the god of this
