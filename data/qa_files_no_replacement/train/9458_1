   in the drawn together episode " breakfast food killer " baba looey made an appearance going by the name " baba booey " .

fa"q"s : ( hey , it 's gary dell'abate from " the howard stern show " )   my nickname baba booey comes from the character baba looey , who was the sidekick of this bumbling equine tv marshal

quick draw mcgraw
