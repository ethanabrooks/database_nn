since mcpike is a known law enforcement official and vinnie is deep undercover , mcpike will often have vinnie arrested on a trumped - up charge so that he can talk to vinnie without revealing his identity ( as he did in the first episode ; frank was the reason vinnie was locked up and he was not happy that frank did not spring him before the sentence was completed ) .

from tv to film : in the ' 80s he was the villainous mel profitt on " wiseguy " ; in 2006 he was the super - villainous lex luthor
