it may be a contraction of old english iunge man , meaning " young man " ( compare knave , meaning " boy " ) , but there are alternative suggestions , such as derivation from an otherwise unattested * geaman ( old frisian gaman , from gea- " province " ) meaning " villager ; rustic " .

hodgepodge : yeoman , as in yeoman of the guard , is probably a contraction of forms of these two words

young man
