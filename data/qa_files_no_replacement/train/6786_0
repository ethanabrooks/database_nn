according to dennis weaver 's comments on the 50th anniversary dvd , disc one , episode " hack prine " , john wayne was never considered for the role ; to have done so would have been preposterous since wayne was a top movie leading man .

television : he placed 6th in the u.s. olympic decathlon trials in 1948 before limping into tv 's " gunsmoke "
