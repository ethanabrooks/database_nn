billboard 's chuck taylor gave a positive review for the song , calling it a " shimmering ballad " that showcases the singer   excelling at what made her a famous : " singing the hell out of a straight ahead love song free of gimmicks , gymnastics and self - conscious attempts at targeting any particular demographic " ; he also said that " never too far " would relieve fans that think carey had been " relying more upon samples and guest vocalists lately than melody and artful performing " .
