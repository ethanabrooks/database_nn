  perhaps the most resonant event was the defense of parma against fascist squadrismo in 1922 : around 10,000 squadristi , first under the command of roberto farinacci , then italo balbo , had to withdraw from the city after 5 days of clashes against a group consisting of socialists , anarchists and communists , controlled by the heads of the arditi del popolo ( 350 took part in the battle against the fascists )

modern history : the arditi , a group of nationalists & wwi vets , were 1st to wear the black shirts of this italian party

the fascists
