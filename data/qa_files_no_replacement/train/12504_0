saint malachy ( ; modern ) ( 1095   – 2 november 1148 ) was an irish saint and archbishop of armagh , to whom were attributed several miracles and an alleged vision of 112 popes later attributed to the apocalyptic list of the prophecy of the popes .

let me make a prediction : around 1143 the irish priest & saint malachy predicted there would only be 111 of these church leaders after his time
