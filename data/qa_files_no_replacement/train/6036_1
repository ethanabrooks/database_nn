the current department of alpes - maritimes , however , does not have only one climate , the complex terrain and high mountains divide the department between those who are well exposed ( the south - facing side ) and those which are less ( the north - facing side ) and even with the mild mediterranean climate there can be violent storms and prolonged droughts .
