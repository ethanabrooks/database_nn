  the bureau of land management ( blm ) has undertaken numerous studies of the salt crust thickness within the bonneville salt flats and ultimately concluded in a 2006 study that there was virtually no difference in the salt crust thickness from 1988 to 2003 .

i'm in such a state ! : the fact that some vehicles have gone more than 600 mph on its bonneville salt flats amazes me
