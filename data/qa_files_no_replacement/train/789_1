early parachuting successes , such as those by louis - sébastien lenormand in 1783 and by balloonist jean - pierre blanchard , had used fixed - canopy parachutes ( that were already " open " before the jump began ) , and although andré-jacques garnerin had invented a frameless parachute suitable for use from high altitudes , by 1910 a parachuting solution that was suitable for use when jumping from a plane or at low altitude had yet to be developed .

what a way to go : franz reichelt died after a 1912 jump from this tall parisian structure testing his parachute - overcoat combo
