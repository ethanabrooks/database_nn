  the cities of assur ( also spelled ashur or aššur ) and nineveh , together with a number of other towns and cities , existed since at least before the middle of the 3rd millennium bc ( c. 2600 bc ) , although they appear to have been sumerian - ruled administrative centres at this time , rather than independent states .
