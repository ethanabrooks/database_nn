the enthalpy of sublimation of lawrencium is estimated to be 352   kj·mol−1 , close to the value of lutetium and strongly suggesting that metallic lawrencium is trivalent with the 7s and 7p1/2 ( or 6d ) electrons delocalized , a prediction also supported by a systematic extrapolation of the values of heat of vaporization , bulk modulus , and atomic volume of neighboring elements to lawrencium .

what the element : lawrencium , named for ernest lawrence , was discovered in one of these -- the linear type , not a cyclotron
