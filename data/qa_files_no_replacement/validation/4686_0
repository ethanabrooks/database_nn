  while nelson preferred rockabilly and uptempo rock songs like " believe what you say " ( hot 100 # 4 ) , " i got a feeling " ( # 10 ) , " my bucket 's got a hole in it " ( # 12 ) , " hello mary lou " ( # 9 ) , " it 's late " ( # 9 ) , " stood up " ( # 2 ) , " waitin ' in school " ( # 18 ) , " be - bop baby " ( # 3 ) , and " just a little too much " ( # 9 ) , his smooth , calm voice made him a natural to sing ballads .

people in song : when ricky nelson said " hello " to her , it was " goodbye heart "
