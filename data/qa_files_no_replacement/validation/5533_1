sedlec ( seidlitz ) was described in a 1867 guide to european spa towns as " a wretched - looking place , hardly meriting the name of a village , and the wells - whence the water should be derived - are a few shallow , circular pits , whose contents very seldom find their way to this country [ ie england ] . " the sedlitz water has a chemical analysis similar to sources in nearby towns such as zaječická hořká from zajecice ( nb german name ' seidschitz ' bitter water ' ) , korozluky ( ger : kollosoruk ) and bílina ( bylany or püllna ) .
