recognised as one of the best english travel books of all time , it chronicled the adventures of himself and hugh carless in nuristan ( kafiristan ) and their attempt to climb the ( then ) unclimbed mountain mir samir .

my favorite films : at one point , john huston wanted gable & bogart to star in this film about 2 schemers who want to rule kafiristan

the man who would be king
