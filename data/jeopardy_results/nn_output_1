Voltaire explains his view of historiography in his article on "History" in Diderot's Encyclopédie: "One demands of modern historians more details, better ascertained facts, precise dates, more attention to customs, laws, mores, commerce, finance, agriculture, population." Voltaire's histories imposed the values of the Enlightenment on the past, but at the same time he helped free historiography from antiquarianism, Eurocentrism, religious intolerance and a concentration on great men, diplomacy, and warfare.
Voltaire also has, in common with Jonathan Swift, the distinction of paving the way for science fiction's philosophical irony, particularly in his Micromégas and the vignette Plato's Dream (1756).

THE LAST CATEGORY: Viaticum, confession & anointing of the sick are part of this Roman Catholic procedure
Last rites
Viaticum is a term used especially in the Catholic Church for the Eucharist (communion) administered, with or without anointing of the sick, to a person who is dying, and is thus a part of the last rites.
3
For Communion as Viaticum, the Eucharist is given in the usual form, with the added words "May the Lord Jesus Christ protect you and lead you to eternal life".
Alternatively, viaticum can refer to an ancient Roman provision or allowance for traveling, originally of transportation and supplies, later of money, made to officials on public missions; mostly simply, the word, a haplology of viā tēcum ("with you on the way"), indicates money or necessities for any journey.

The Naked Sun is an English language science fiction novel, the second in Isaac Asimov's Robot series.

LITERARY HEROINES: Thorny problems beset this Bronte heroine when she's hired as a governess at Thornfield Hall
Jane Eyre
Thornfield Hall is the home of the male romantic lead, Edward Rochester, in the 1847 novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë where much of the action takes place.
3
Haddon Hall has been used to depict Thornfield on multiple occasions: for the 1996 film directed by Franco Zeffirelli, in 2006 for the BBC mini series directed by Susanna White, and for the 2011 feature starring Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender directed by Cary Fukunaga.
Another theory holds that North Lees Hall in Hathersage was the inspiration for Thornfield, particularly given that "Morton" in the novel is believed  to be based on Hathersage, and that Bronte stayed in the area before writing the novel.
A third theory is that High Sunderland Hall in Halifax was the basis for Thornfield.
