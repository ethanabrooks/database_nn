THE SUN BELT: In about 5 billion years, the Sun will expand & become a red this; outer layers may reach 2 or even (gulp!) 3 planets
a giant
Formation The Sun was formed about 4.57 billion years ago from the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars.
3
This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state, if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.
The theory that the Sun is the center around which the planets orbit was first proposed by the ancient Greek Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd century BC, and later adopted by Seleucus of Seleucia (see Heliocentrism).
This largely philosophical view was developed into fully predictive mathematical model of a heliocentric system in the 16th century by Nicolaus Copernicus.
SPACE: This planet has the fastest orbit around the Sun
Mercury
It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth.
3
The visible surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is the layer below which the Sun becomes opaque to visible light.
After about 20 million years on the early AGB, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so.
This enables stereoscopic imaging of the Sun and solar phenomena, such as coronal mass ejections.

LORDS A-LEAPING: In 1935 John Buchan became Lord Tweedsmuir & his novel "The Thirty-Nine Steps" was filmed by this director
Alfred Hitchcock
In 1935 Buchan's literary work was adapted to the cinematic theatre with the completion of Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps, starring Robert Donat as Richard Hannay, though with Buchan's story much altered.

Buchan conveyed to Buckingham Palace and British prime minister Stanley Baldwin Canadians' deep affection for the King, but also the outrage to Canadian religious feelings, both Catholic and Protestant, that would occur if Edward married Simpson.
Still, Buchan authorised Canada's declaration of war against Germany in September, shortly after the British declaration of war and with the consent of King George; and, thereafter, issued orders of deployment for Canadian soldiers, airmen, and seamen as the titular commander-in-chief of the Canadian armed forces.

POTPOURRI: Huitzilopochtli was the war & sun god of this civilization
Aztecs
He was also the national god of the Mexicas, also known as Aztecs, of Tenochtitlan.

It is important to remember that the defeat of their patron deity meant the defeat of his people.
Despite the popularity of these latter interpretations, Huitzilopochtli's name most probably does not mean "left-handed/southern hummingbird" considering that the Classical Nahuatl huītzilin ("hummingbird") is the modifier of ōpōchtli ("left-hand side") in this compound rather than the reverse;In Nahuatl, as in English, compound nouns are composed of a head preceded by modifying nominals, and thus Huītzilōpōchtli does not mean "
Panquetzaliztli (7 December to 26 December) was the Aztec month dedicated to Huitzilopochtli.

THE FAMILY JULES: His novels have inspired many movies, beginning with Georges Melies' "A Trip to the Moon"
Jules Verne
Inspired by a wide variety of sources, including Jules Verne's novels From the Earth to the Moon and Around the Moon, the film follows a group of astronomers who travel to the Moon in a cannon-propelled capsule, explore the Moon's surface, escape from an underground group of Selenites (lunar inhabitants), and return to Earth with a captive Selenite.
3
Scholars have commented upon the film's extensive use of pataphysical and anti-imperialist satire, as well as on its wide influence on later film-makers and its artistic significance within the French theatrical féerie tradition.
When the film was screened at the Olympia music hall in Paris in 1902, an original film score was reportedly written for it.
Chiara Ferrari's essay on the film in 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, which places A Trip to the Moon as the first entry, argues that the film "directly reflects the histrionic personality of its director", and that the film "deserves a legitimate place among the milestones in world cinema history."
