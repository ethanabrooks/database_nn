The pre-modern etymology of her name, from tithemi (τίθημι), "to set up, establish," suggests a perception among Classical Greeks of an early political role.

TV VARIETY SHOWS: In 1968 comedian Pat Paulsen began a campaign for president on this duo's comedy/variety hour
the Smothers Brothers
Patrick Layton "Pat" Paulsen (July 6, 1927 – April 24, 1997) was an American comedian and satirist notable for his roles on several of the Smothers Brothers TV shows, and for his campaigns for President of the United States in 1968, 1972, 1980, 1988, 1992, and 1996, which had primarily comedic rather than political objectives, although his campaigns generated some protest votes for him.
3
Pat's character had a photographic memory and ended up with the "girl(s)", much to the surprise of agents James West (Robert Conrad) and Jeremy Pike (Charles Aidman).
During the inaugural season of Sesame Street (1969–1970), Paulsen appeared in a series of comical skits: reciting the alphabet, and fumbling on a few of the letters; counting to 10 and to 20, and forgetting a few of the numbers; and talking about the word "full" with a wastebasket full of wastepapers that fall out the bottom of the basket, forcing him to talk about the word "empty" instead.
