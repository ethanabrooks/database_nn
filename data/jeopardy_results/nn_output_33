Jerusalem
According to standard biblical chronology, this event would have taken place at about 1300 BCE (AM 2450).The Seder Olam Rabbah calculates the lifespan of Moses as 1391–1271 BCE, which would correspond to a date of the Exodus of forty years before 1271, i.e. 1311 BCE.

ROGER THAT!: Sir Roger Penrose, with Stephen Hawking, proved that all matter within one of these collapses to a singularity
a black hole
thumb|300px|right| Predicted view from outside the horizon of a black hole lit by a thin accretion disc It was in the local context of gravitational collapse that the contribution of Penrose was most decisive, starting with his 1969 cosmic censorship conjecture, to the effect that any ensuing singularities would be confined within a well-behaved event horizon  surrounding a hidden space-time region for which Wheeler coined the term black hole, leaving a visible exterior region with strong but finite curvature, from which some of the gravitational energy may be extractable by what is known as the Penrose process, while accretion of surrounding matter may release further energy that can account for astrophysical phenomena such as quasars.

He devised and popularised the Penrose triangle in the 1950s, describing it as "impossibility in its purest form" and exchanged material with the artist M. C. Escher, whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it.
Marvin Minsky, a leading proponent of artificial intelligence, was particularly critical, stating that Penrose "tries to show, in chapter after chapter, that human thought cannot be based on any known scientific principle." Minsky's position is exactly the opposite –
These proposed alternative processes have the advantage of taking place within Tegmark's time to decoherence.

SUNSHINE: Green plants use the Sun's rays to turn water & this gas into carbohydrates

In 1997, the CIPM added that the preceding definition "refers to a caesium atom at rest at a temperature of 0 K."  SI prefixes are combined with the word second to denote subdivisions of the second, e.g., the millisecond (one thousandth of a second), the microsecond (one millionth of a second), and the nanosecond (one billionth of a second).

Both the CGS and MKS systems used the same second as their base unit of time.

SECONDS, PLEASE: In 1969 Buzz Aldrin became the second to set foot here
the moon
Based on subdivisions of the moon cycle In 1000, the Persian scholar al-Biruni, writing in Arabic, first used the term second, and defined the division of time between new moons of certain specific weeks as a number of days, hours, minutes, seconds, thirds, and fourths after noon Sunday.
3
The use of the word second in English began in the late 16th century.
This mechanism required less power, caused less friction and was accurate enough to measure seconds reliably as one-sixtieth of a minute than the older verge escapement.
In practice, however, the definition means that high-precision realizations of the second should compensate for the effects of the ambient temperature (black-body radiation) within which atomic clocks operate, and extrapolate accordingly to the value of the second at a temperature of absolute zero.

THEIR FIRST NOVELS: "The Time Machine" (1895)
H.G. Wells
Scholarship Significant scholarly commentary on The Time Machine began from the early 1960s, initially contained in various broad studies of Wells's early novels (such as Bernard Bergonzi's The Early H.G. Wells: A Study of the Scientific Romances) and studies of utopias/dystopias in science fiction (such as Mark R. Hillegas's The Future as Nightmare: H.G. Wells and the Anti-Utopians).

It features a "manuscript", which reports the Time Traveller's activities after the end of the original story.
In 2006, Monsterwax Trading Cards combined The Time Machine with two of Wells's other stories, The Island of Dr. Moreau and The War of the Worlds.
Much of the book is occupied with his deeply unsettling discoveries about the Morlock/Eloi symbiosis, his gradual assimilation into Morlock society, and his ultimately successful attempt to discover the true cause of humanity's catastrophic transformation into two such tragic races.
