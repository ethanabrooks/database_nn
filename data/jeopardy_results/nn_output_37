LITERATURE IN THE 1800s: The first chapter of this Carlo Collodi classic appeared in an Italian children's magazine in 1881
Pinocchio
Carlo Lorenzini, better known by the pen name Carlo Collodi (; 24 November 1826 – 26 October 1890), was a children's writer born in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and writer of the world-renowned fairy tale novel The Adventures of Pinocchio.
3
In 1876 Lorenzini wrote Giannettino (inspired by Alessandro Luigi Parravicini's Giannetto), the Minuzzolo, and Il viaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino, a pedagogic series which explored the re-unification of Italy through the ironic thoughts and actions of the character Giannettino.
Lorenzini became fascinated by the idea of using an amiable, rascally character as a means of expressing his own convictions through allegory.
He is buried at San Miniato al Monte Basilica.

The Hebrew word 'ahav, meaning "love," has a very broad range of meanings, including simply the opposite of "hate" (The New Brown-Driver-Briggs-Gesenius Hebrew and English Lexicon [1978], p. 12), which can be shown by loyalty, as in 1 Samuel 18:16, "All Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns."

The second thus defined is consistent with the ephemeris second, which was based on astronomical measurements.
In 1832, Gauss proposed using the second as the base unit of time in his millimeter-milligram-second system of units.
Based on a fraction of a year In 1956, the second was redefined in terms of a year (the period of the Earth's revolution around the Sun) for a particular epoch because, by then, it had become recognized that the Earth's rotation on its own axis was not sufficiently uniform as a standard of time.

The British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) in 1862 stated that "All men of science are agreed to use the second of mean solar time as the unit of time."
Thus, the 1960 SI definition abandoned any explicit relationship between the scientific second and the length of a day, as most people understand the term.
See page 515 in   The definition of the second was later refined at the 1997 meeting of the BIPM to include the statement  The revised definition seems to imply that the ideal atomic clock contains a single caesium atom at rest emitting a single frequency.

In 1997, the CIPM added that the preceding definition "refers to a caesium atom at rest at a temperature of 0 K."  SI prefixes are combined with the word second to denote subdivisions of the second, e.g., the millisecond (one thousandth of a second), the microsecond (one millionth of a second), and the nanosecond (one billionth of a second).

The second became accurately measurable with the development of mechanical clocks keeping mean time, as opposed to the apparent time displayed by sundials.
This mechanism required less power, caused less friction and was accurate enough to measure seconds reliably as one-sixtieth of a minute than the older verge escapement.
Thus, the 1960 SI definition abandoned any explicit relationship between the scientific second and the length of a day, as most people understand the term.

-Vsmith 00:52, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)  POLL CLOSED  Proposal 2 (A)   Replace the policy:  8.3 Commas  As stated by Kate Turabian's A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, the Chicago Manual of Style, Strunk and White, and other authoritative sources, when a conjunction joins the last two elements in a series of three or more elements, a comma is used before the conjunction: "The wires were brown, blue, and green.
3
Consider the following sentences:   "The author would like to thank her parents, Sinéad and Bob."
Hence: A, B and C. I believe you mean implies, not infers.
Keep it like it is.-Vsmith 01:02, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)  POLL CLOSED  Comments I would support allowing authors to choose whichever style sounds better if clarity is not an issue, but as the serial comma has actual utility and the alternate style is just some people's preference, I'd rather see our policy favor the serial comma a little more strongly than this proposal does.
U.S. PLACE NAMES: "Sew" what you're saying is this California city, on the edge of the Mojave Desert, is named for some really sharp peaks
Needles
One can argue about the order of the two congratulators, and about active vs. passive voice, but the essential difference is using the phrase "committee chairman John Smith" rather than "John Smith, committee chairman" (which introduces the ambiguity of parenthetical commas) or "John Smith, who is committee chairman" (which removes the ambiguity, but is needlessly verbose).
3
The person who started it didn’t even sign the proposal.
The Oxford comma is more popular in the U.S. than in the UK, though probably more people use the Oxford comma in the UK than don't (though the non-Oxford comma approach has been gaining popularity in the UK for as long as I can remember).
RickK 20:43, Nov 1, 2004 (UTC) OK - but what about if the proposal was reworded along the lines you suggest?
ENDS WITH 2 VOWELS: The Hindi word for "tea", in the U.S. it refers to a blend of tea, spices & milk; try a cup!
chai
"Joe Bloggs was congratulated by John Smith, the Chairman of the committee, and Jane Doe."
3
Of the two options, the serial comma is much more logical.
I will address separately the cited reasons for changing policy above, and why they are spurious:  There are two styles for lists that are in common English usage: A, B, and C and A, B and C. Wikipedia should not favour one over the other.

Betty Friedan
The Feminine Mystique is a 1963 book by Betty Friedan which is widely credited with sparking the beginning of second-wave feminism in the United States.
3
Chapter 2: Friedan shows that the editorial decisions concerning women's magazines were being made mostly by men, who insisted on stories and articles that showed women as either happy housewives or unhappy careerists, thus creating the "feminine mystique"—the idea that women were naturally fulfilled by devoting their lives to being housewives and mothers.
Chapter 5: Friedan, who had a degree in psychology, criticizes Sigmund Freud (whose ideas were very influential in America at the time of her book's publication).
Friedan says that women need meaningful work just as men do to achieve self-actualization, the highest level on the hierarchy of needs.

In April 1966, Washkansky visited Groote Schuur Hospital due to his pre-existing illness.
Although Washkansky died of pneumonia eighteen days after the transplant because of a weakened immune system, Barnard regarded the surgery as a success because the heart was "not being stimulated by an electrical machine" but completely by Washkansky.
As Barnard related in his book, One Life, a decision was made on the fifth postoperative day to bombard Washkansky's system with immunosuppressants to guard against a potential rejection of the new heart.

Virgil
The Eclogues (;  ), also called the Bucolics, is the first of the three major works of the Latin poet Virgil.
3
The poet makes this notional scion of Jove the occasion to predict his own metabasis up the scale in epos, rising from the humble range of the bucolic to the lofty range of the heroic, potentially rivaling Homer: he thus signals his own ambition to make Roman epic that will culminate in the Aeneid.
