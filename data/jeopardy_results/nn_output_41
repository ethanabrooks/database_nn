TV TITLE CHARACTER PROFESSIONS: "The Rockford Files"
Private investigator
Garner portrays Los Angeles-based private investigator Jim Rockford with Noah Beery, Jr., in the supporting role of his father, a retired truck driver nicknamed "Rocky".
3
The Rockford Files is an American television drama series starring James Garner that aired on the  NBC network between September 13, 1974, and January 10, 1980, and has remained in syndication to the present day.
In doing so, Angel almost always gets Rockford in trouble, usually by involving him in hare-brained scams...often without Jim's knowledge, and never with his consent.
The dispute was settled out of court in Garner's favor, but the conflict meant that the Rockford character would not re-emerge until 1994.

SCOTLAND: Ben Lomond, Ben Venue & Ben Wyvis are these
mountains
A study by the British Trust for Ornithology found that Ben Lomond may host the most southerly breeding ptarmigan population in Scotland, following the decline of these populations on Goatfell and the Arran mountains, potentially as a result of climate change.

Ben Lomond lies within the Ben Lomond National Memorial Park and the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, property of the National Trust for Scotland.
On a clear day, it is visible from the higher grounds of Glasgow and eastwards across the low-lying central valley of Scotland; this may have led to it being named 'Beacon Mountain', as with the equally far-seen Lomond Hills in Fife.
Fauna  The higher regions of the mountain support an alpine tundra ecozone, hosting bird species including peregrine falcon, merlins, rock ptarmigan, red grouse and golden eagles.

WELL, IT'S NOT SHAKESPEARE: Last name of David, the screenwriter who wrote "Speed-the-Plow", a play about greedy producers
Mamet
Speed-the-Plow (1988) is a play by David Mamet which is a satirical dissection of the American movie business, a theme Mamet would revisit in his later films Wag the Dog (1997) and State and Main (2000).
3
The play sets its context with an epigram (not to be recited in performance) by William Makepeace Thackeray, from his novel Pendennis, contained in a frontispiece: It starts: "Which is the most reasonable, and does his duty best: he who stands aloof from the struggle of life, calmly contemplating it, or he who descends to the ground, and takes his part in the contest?" The character of Bobby Gould finds himself on both sides of this dilemma, and at times in the play he "stands aloof," and at other times he "takes part" in life's contest, with its moral strictures.
Gould surprises Fox with news that instead he is going to be pitching the Radiation book, without him.

Prior to Butteridge, nobody had succeeded in producing a practical heavier-than-air machine, only a few awkward devices of limited utility such as the German "Drachenflieger", which had to be towed aloft and released from an airship.
Following this, the vengeful Prince orders a wholesale destruction, airships moving along Broadway and systematically raining death and destruction on the population below.
The Butteridge machine is cheap, easy and quick to build, and needs no big fields to take off or land – which mean it can be built and operated not only by national governments, but also by private groups, local militias, and even bandits – a development which tends to break up the war into a vast, incoherent multitude of localised struggles and which accelerates the already-begun process of break-up and disintegration of the world's nations.

In the chase which followed Durward saved the king's life from a boar, for which service Louis, after consulting with his barber, entrusted him with the duty of conducting the Countess and Lady Hameline, ostensibly to the protection of the Bishop of Liege, but really that they might fall into the hands of William de la Marck.
With the syndic's help Lady Isabella and her protector reached Charleroi, where she was placed in a convent, while he carried the news to the Duke of Burgundy, at whose court Louis, with a small retinue, was a guest.
Quentin, who had learnt his plans from the Bohemian, advanced with the allied troops of France and Burgundy against his stronghold, and a desperate battle ensued.

Where previously he has "never in his life known anything but one straight line," the kind behavior of Valjean compels him to see two: "both equal straight," and "contradictory."

Thénardier, however, does not want to become involved with the police, and tells Javert that the girl was fetched by her grandfather, and that he saw the man's passport.
