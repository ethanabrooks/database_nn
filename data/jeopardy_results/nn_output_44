History thumb|300px|left|A map of northern Europe after Ptolemy Historically, when Europe was dominated by the Mediterranean region (i.e., the Roman Empire), everything not near this sea was termed northern Europe, including Germany, the Low Countries, and Austria.
The region has a south west extreme of around 50 degrees north and a northern extreme of 81 degrees north.
Just as both climate and relief are variable across the region, so too is vegetation also extremely variable, with sparse tundra in the north and high mountains, boreal forest on the north-eastern and central regions temperate coniferous forests (formerly of which a majority was in the Scottish highlands and south west Norway) and temperate broadleaf forests growing in the south, west and temperate east.

THE LADYKILLERS: In his "An American Tragedy", Clyde muses that Roberta "could not swim-- could not swim-- could not swim"
Theodore Dreiser
An American Tragedy (1925) is a novel by the American writer Theodore Dreiser.
3
Roberta, unable to swim, drowns while Clyde, unwilling to save her, swims to shore.
The novel is a tragedy in the strict sense, Clyde's destruction being the consequence of his innate weaknesses: moral and physical cowardice, lack of scruple and self-discipline, muddled intellect and unfocused ambition; additionally, the effect of his ingratiating (Dreiser uses the word "soft") social manner places temptation in his way which he cannot resist.

COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: San Pellegrino, as in sparkling natural mineral water
Italy
San Pellegrino (also S. Pellegrino) is an Italian brand of mineral water, and assorted real-fruit sodas, with carbonation added by the bottler, produced and bottled by Nestlé Waters at San Pellegrino Terme, in the Province of Bergamo, Lombardy, Italy.

The springs are located at the foot of a dolomite mountain wall which favours the formation and replenishment of a mineral water basin.
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the company continued to expand, and in 1988, San Pellegrino became the first Italian mineral water brand to be exported to France.
Nestlé was informed about this and responded that uranium was common in both bottled and tap water, and that the level in their product was below the threshold of harmful levels noted by various governments and food health organizations.

FOOTBALL: 49ers coach Red Hickey pioneered this formation with the quarterback a few yards behind the center
shotgun
Howard Wayne "Red" Hickey (February 14, 1917 — March 30, 2006) was an American professional football player and coach who played for two teams and served as head coach for the San Francisco 49ers, where he was most famous for creating the shotgun formation in 1960.
3
He remained in that capacity with the team for six seasons until resigning on December 12, 1954 along with his fellow assistants.
Hickey sought to find a way to combat the Colts' strong pass rush and reasoned that having a quarterback stand seven yards back from the line of scrimmage would give the signal caller more time to throw, as well as force adjustments by Baltimore.
On an individual level, he was elected to the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame in 1968, while his son, Mike, followed him into the world of scouting, working for the New England Patriots and New York Jets.

HIT TV SHOWS IN OTHER WORDS: On HBO: "Those highest natural singing voices"
The Sopranos
Many HBO programs have been syndicated to other networks and broadcast television stations (usually after some editing), and a number of HBO-produced series and films have been released on DVD. Since HBO's more successful series (most notably shows such as Sex and the City, The Sopranos, The Wire, Entourage, Six Feet Under, Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones and True Blood) air on over-the-air broadcasters in other countries (such as in Canada, Australia and much of Europe – including the United Kingdom), HBO's programming has the potential of being exposed to a higher percentage of the population of those countries compared to the United States.
