The Constitution
The plan was drafted by James Madison while he waited for a quorum to assemble at the Constitutional Convention of 1787.

TV SPIN-OFFS: "The Bionic Woman"
The Six Million Dollar Man
The Bionic Woman is an American television series starring Lindsay Wagner that aired for three seasons between 1976 and 1978 as a spin-off from The Six Million Dollar Man.
2
The series proved highly popular worldwide, gaining high ratings in the US and particularly so in the UK (where it became the only Science fiction programme to achieve the No.1 position in the ratings during the 20th Century).
This was due in part to the change of networks which prevented any more crossovers by Jaime's former love-interest, Steve Austin; however, in a situation still considered unique, Anderson and Brooks continued to play their roles in both series, despite the network differential.

RUSSIAN COMPOSERS: In 1856, at age 12, this "Flight Of The Bumblebee" composer entered a naval academy & remained in the navy for 17 years
Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov
"Flight of the Bumblebee" is an orchestral interlude written by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov for his opera The Tale of Tsar Saltan, composed in 1899–1900.
3
Although in the opera the Swan-Bird sings during the first part of the "Flight", her vocal line is melodically uninvolved and easily omitted; this feature, combined with the fact that the number decisively closes the scene, made easy extraction as an orchestral concerto piece possible.
Overview Here is the text of the scene where the Swan-Bird sings during this music:   Russian  English translation (Гвидон спускается с берега в море. Из моря вылетает шмель, кружась около Лебедь-Птицы.) ЛЕБЕДЬ-ПТИЦА: Ну, теперь, мой шмель, гуляй, (Nu, teper', moy shmel', gulyay,) судно в море догоняй, (sudno v more dogonyay,) потихоньку опускайся, (potikhon'ku opuskaysya,) в щель подальше забивайся. (v shchel' podal'she zabivaysya.) Будь здоров, Гвидон, лети, (Bud' zdorov, Gvidon, leti,) только долго не гости! (tol'ko dolgo ne gosti!) (Шмель улетает.) (Gvidon goes down from the shore into the sea.
"Flight of the Bumblebee" is recognizable for its frantic pace when played up to tempo, with nearly uninterrupted runs of chromatic sixteenth notes.
