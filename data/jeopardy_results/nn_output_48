A Place in the Sun
She made the transition to adult roles in the early 1950s, when she starred in the comedy Father of the Bride (1950) and received critical acclaim for her performance in the tragic drama A Place in the Sun (1951).

Biographer Alexander Walker agrees that Taylor appeared older than her age, and looked different from the era's child stars, such as Shirley Temple and Judy Garland.
The studio also wanted to dye her hair and change the shape of her eyebrows, and proposed that she use the screen name "Virginia", but Taylor and her parents refused.
She and Burton starred as Martha and George, a middle-aged couple going through a marital crisis.
THE CINEMA: 50 YEARS AGO: This Spencer Tracy-Elizabeth Taylor film was followed 1 year later with a sequel, "Father's Little Dividend"
Father of the Bride

A GENRE-OUS HELPING: Cyril Tourneur liked this basic dramatic genre; "The Atheist's" one & "The Revenger's" one are attributed to him
tragedy
Cyril Tourneur (died 28 February 1626) was an English soldier, diplomat and dramatist who wrote The Atheist's Tragedy (published 1611); another (and better-known) play, The Revenger's Tragedy (1607), formerly believed to be by him, is now more generally  attributed to Thomas Middleton.
3
A case has been made by Johan Gerritsen that Tourneur is the author of the first act of The Honest Man's Fortune (1613), a play from the Beaumont & Fletcher canon usually attributed to John Fletcher, Philip Massinger and Nathan Field.
In addition there is a lost play, The Nobleman, and the lost Arraignment of London written with Robert Daborne.
This and Tourneur's other uncontested works, show him to be "a traditional Christian moralist, with a consistent didactic bent."Gunby (n.d.)
