THE SWEET 1600s: William Harvey showed that this organ is the center of circulation, not the liver as had been thought
Heart
He was the first known to describe completely and in detail the systemic circulation and properties of blood being pumped to the brain and body by the heart, though earlier writers, such as Miguel Servet (aka Michael Servetus, Michel de Villeneuve) in: 'Restitutio Christianismi', Paris, 1546, and Jacques Dubois, had provided precursors of the theory.

ACRONYMS: Acronymically, "KISS" means "Keep it" this way, "stupid"
simple
As a reward "Chloe has bestowed a kiss on Daphnis—an innocent young-maid's kiss, but it has on him the effect of an electrical shock":  Romantic kissing "requires more than simple proximity," notes Cane.

Kissing on the lips with mouth closed was called an basium, which was used between relatives.
Runeberg says that the angels rejoice over the first kiss exchanged by lovers," and can keep one feeling young: "It carries life with it; it even bestows the gift of eternal youth." The importance of the lover's kiss can also be significant, he notes: "In the case of lovers a kiss is everything; that is the reason why a man stakes his all for a kiss," and "man craves for it as his noblest reward."  As a result, kissing as an expression of love is contained in much of literature, old and new.
After a first date, it is common for the couple to give each other a quick kiss on the cheek (or lips where that is the norm) on parting, to indicate that a good time was had and perhaps to indicate an interest in another meeting.

ARCHBISHOPS OF YORK: Nicholas Heath, in office from 1555 to 1579, was the last archbishop of this faith
Catholicism
His Catholicism, however, was of a less rigid type than Gardiner's and Bonner's; he felt something of the force of the national antipathy to foreign influence, whether ecclesiastical or secular, and was always impressed by the necessity of national unity, so far as was possible, in matters of faith.
3
After holding minor preferments he was appointed archdeacon of Stafford in 1534 and graduated DD in 1535.
Heath refused to accept it, was imprisoned, and in 1551 deprived of his bishopric.
Like others of Henry's bishops, he had been convinced by the events of Edward VI's reign that Sir Thomas More was right and Henry VIII was wrong in their attitude towards the claims of the papacy and the Roman Catholic Church.

POETIC POTPOURRI: The 1816 sonnet "On First Looking Into Chapman's Homer" was the first mature poem by this ode poet
John Keats
"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer" is a sonnet written by the English Romantic poet John Keats (1795–1821) in October 1816.
3
It tells of the author's astonishment while reading the works of the ancient Greek poet Homer as freely translated by the Elizabethan playwright George Chapman.
The poem has become an often-quoted classic, cited to demonstrate the emotional power of a great work of art, and the ability of great art to create an epiphany in its beholder.
The second quatrain introduces "one wide expanse" that was ruled by Homer, but which was "heard of" rather than known to Keats at first-hand, for Homer wrote in Greek, and Keats, like most cultured Englishmen of his time, was at ease only in Latin.

Many newspapers, weeklies, and online news sources do follow the NYT, but anything other than casual reading will reveal an untoward increase of bad grammar, spelling, and even occasional outright incomprehensibility in such sources (especially those online feeds) that I suspect reflects significant budget cuts in the print media's proofreading departments and a general "don't-care" approach to proofing online and in AP and other newsfeeds.
