IT'S OUR TURN TO SACK ROME!!!: 1527 A.D.: French & German troops working for this "Empire" end the High Renaissance by sacking Rome
the Holy Roman Empire
The Holy Roman Empire was not always centrally-governed, as it had neither core nor peripheral territories, and was not governed by a central, politico-military elite.

The empire was founded in 322 BC by Chandragupta Maurya, who rapidly expanded his power westward across central and western India, taking advantage of the disruptions of local powers following the withdrawal by Alexander the Great.
Both existed for several generations before the arrival of the Europeans.

Coppola is one of only eight filmmakers to win two Palme d'Or awards.
Coppola wrote a brief draft story idea in one night, incorporating elements from Hitchcock's Psycho, and the result impressed Corman enough to give him the go-ahead.

See George E. Hastings, The Life and Works of Francis Hopkinson.
His first letter in May 25, 1780, requesting compensation from Congress was almost comical.
A parallel flag for the national flag was most likely intended by Hopkinson with white, outer stripes as on the Great Seal of the United States and on the Bennington flag, which commemorated 50th anniversary of the founding of the United States (1826).

Aluminium-silicon alloys (called silumin alloys) are heavily used in the aluminium alloy casting industry, where silicon is the single most important additive to aluminium to improve its casting properties.
With oxides of other elements, the high temperature reaction of silicon dioxide can give a wide range of mixed glasses and glass-like network solids with various properties.
For example, in silicon photonics, silicon can be used as a continuous wave Raman laser medium to produce coherent light, though it is ineffective as an everyday light source.

BIBLICAL BAD STUFF: Daniel tells Belshazzar, ruler of this kingdom, you've "lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven"
Babylon
Belshazzar (; Biblical Hebrew בלשאצר; Akkadian: Bēl-šarra-uṣur; Greek: Balthazar, from Akkadian, meaning "Protect His Life"; or, possibly, "[May] Bel Protect the King";) was Coregent of Babylon, governing the country after his father, King Nabonidus, went into exile in 550 BCE. Belshazzar died after Babylon fell to the Persians in 539 BCE.  According to the Book of Daniel, Belshazzar holds a last great feast at which he sees a hand writing on a wall with the Aramaic words mene, mene, tekel, upharsin, which Daniel interprets as a judgment from God foretelling the fall of Babylon.
3
This is evident from a number of texts recovered from the ancient archives proving that Belshazzar exercised royal prerogatives, that he issued orders and commands.
The text in the imperial Assyrian language says that the statue was of "the governor of Gozan".

BOOKS & AUTHORS: A writer named Nathan Zuckerman is featured in several books by this author
Philip Roth
Nathan Zuckerman is a fictional character created by the writer Philip Roth, who uses him as his protagonist and narrator, a type of alter ego, in many of his novels."Philip Roth's 'Ghost' Returns", NPR, 25 September 2007  Character Roth first created a character named Nathan Zuckerman in the novel My Life as a Man (1974), where he is the "product" of another fictional Roth figure, the writer Peter Tarnopol (making Zuckerman, in his original form, an "alter-alter-ego").

James, Clive. "Falter Ego", New York Times, 7 October 2007  Analysis By creating parallels between Zuckerman's life as a novelist (with the novel Carnovsky a stand-in for his Portnoy's Complaint) and his own, Roth expressed his interest in the relationship between an author and his work.
The British Indian author Salman Rushdie used Zuckerman as a character in his novel The Ground Beneath Her Feet (1999), where in an alternate universe, it is the literary alter-egos (and their novels) that are real.

There IS relevance in that logic, Im sorry if you fail to see it.
My impression is that "U.S. American" is inoffensive and not an ugly neologism, so how about replacing "American" with it like in "Thomas Edison was a U.S. American inventor" ?
At first I thought it clunky, but it fits and certainly reads better than using "United States" as a adjective and avoids awful neologisms.

That's when referring to the government.
This sort of distinction with respect to connotations may very well not exist outside of the US, which could explain why even English-speakers outside of the US may use "America" in places where Americans would use "US".
"American" in most contexts means "of America (USA)", i.e., a US citizen, a US car or movie, a US government policy  However, many residents of countries to the south of the USA, particularly Mexico, use the English word differently.

Ethan Frome is a novel published in 1911 by the Pulitzer Prize-winning American author Edith Wharton.

A severe snowstorm during one of their journeys forces Frome to allow the narrator to shelter at his home one night.
He feels that he cannot abandon Zeena because he knows that she would neither be able to run the farm nor sell it (the poor quality of the place has been discussed at several points in the story already).
Jeffrey Lilburn notes that some find "the suffering endured by Wharton's characters is excessive and unjustified," but others see the difficult moral questions addressed and note that it "provides insightful commentary on the American economic and cultural realities that produced and allowed such suffering." Trilling and other critics found Ethan Frome to have no moral content, but Elizabeth Ammons disagreed with that concept.

Miranda realizes that if she wants to continue with her surgical career, she will not be able to remain in control of the clinic, and so hands over the reins to Izzie Stevens, telling her she has earned it.
Ultimately, Bailey decided to continue to pursue her career in General Surgery because she had a fight with her husband who said that if she accepted a position as a Peds fellow, he would divorce her.
Reviewing the show's fourth season, Patrick Luce of Monsters and Critics found Bailey "one of the most interesting characters to watch" as "she had to deal with losing a promotion to Sara Ramírez’s Dr. Torres; her own marriage trouble; and the continued stress of balancing being a mom and being a doctor."
