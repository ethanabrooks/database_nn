MEDICINE: This infection of the intestines is caused by a bacterium called Salmonella typhi
typhoid fever
Strains of Salmonella cause illnesses such as typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, and food poisoning (salmonellosis).
3
Initially, Salmonella Choleraesuis was thought to be the causative agent of hog cholera, so Salmon and Smith named it "Hog-cholerabacillus".
The increased prevalence of iNTS in sub-Saharan Africa compared to other regions is thought to be due to the large proportion of the African population with some degree of immune suppression or impairment due to the burden of HIV, malaria, and malnutrition, especially in children.
In the systemic form of the disease, salmonellae pass through the lymphatic system of the intestine into the blood of the patients (typhoid form) and are carried to various organs (liver, spleen, kidneys) to form secondary foci (septic form).

Bridget Jones's Diary
Grant has expanded his oeuvre with critically acclaimed turns as a cad in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), About a Boy (2002), and American Dreamz (2006).

Though he neither listens to music nor owns any CDs, Grant learned to sing, play the piano, dance (a few mannered steps) and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare for his role as a has-been pop singer, based loosely on Andrew Ridgeley, the lesser-known member of 1980s pop duo Wham!.
Glenn Kenny of Rogerebert.com gave film a mixed review but stated that "while it can’t be said that Hugh Grant saves the movie, his return to prominence in the last half hour, after a plot-seeding-walk-on earlier in the movie, peps things up considerably."
Film historian David Thomson wrote in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film about how it is merely "itchy mannerisms" that Grant equates with screen acting.

BOOKS FOR THE BRAVE: Your grasp of this French existentialist's "Being and Nothingness" may be closer to nothingness
Jean-Paul Sartre
Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology (), sometimes subtitled A Phenomenological Essay on Ontology, is a 1943 book by philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre.
3
Summary In the introduction, Sartre sketches his own theory of consciousness, being, and phenomena through criticism of both earlier phenomenologists (most notably Husserl and Heidegger) as well as idealists, rationalists, and empiricists.
By viewing one's ego as it once was rather than as it currently is, one ends up negating the current self and replacing it with a past self that no longer exists.
This non-positional quality of consciousness is what makes it a unique type of being, a being that exists for itself.

U.S. CABINET DEPARTMENTS IN OTHER WORDS: Giving birth
Labor
John FitzGerald 22:03, 24 November 2005 (UTC)  Please do not take my bluntness or harshness as a sign of disrespect or trolling; while I do have a sufficient grasp on english to elaborate a conversation, sometimes the "weight" of the words is miscalculated (and some are mispelled, as well!).

As for Shaw and Wilde, their pages list them as being Irish.
We have an obligation to avoid ambiguity.
It's not 'wrong' to call yourself American if you are a U.S. citizen, but it is ambiguous - in many parts of the world saying an 'American author' would not rule out the author coming from South America or Canada.
CANADA, MEXICO OR THE U.S.: The most populous
the U.S.
More seriously, "American" is the only usable word for "citizen of the U.S." (as in, "my nationality is American"), but "U.S." should probably be used whenever possible ("the U.S. government undertook this action" as opposed to "the American government") for precision's sake.
3
That could be a way to move around the dispute, being precise, political correct and including the American part (U.S.-)Americans seems to be proud of.
John FitzGerald 00:20, 22 November 2005 (UTC)
However, in fairness, I like the compromise of U.S. American.

Either way, this attitude is what sets the fires of ill-will towards US citizens in general ablaze.
If you would be so kind as to re-read what I wrote...
Thus, citizens of that new country were changing the use of a word that was already consagrated by use, therefore my choice of the term "posterior usage".

2

BIBLICAL PEOPLE: Hagar was this woman's maidservant
Sarah
She was an Egyptian handmaid of Sarai (Sarah), who gave her to Abraham "to wife" to bear a child.

When Hagar realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.
Neither Sara nor Hājar are mentioned by name in the Qur'an, but the story is traditionally understood to be referred to in a line from Ibrāhīm's prayer in Sura Ibrahim (14:37): "I have settled some of my family in a barren valley near your Sacred House."Barbara Freyer Stowasser, Women in the Qur'an, Traditions, and Interpretation, New York: Oxford University Press, 1996, p.47.
The giving of this name is often taken as a controversial political act, marking the parents as being supporters of reconciliation with the Palestinians and Arab World, and is frowned upon by many, including nationalists and the religious.

THAT TITLE IS TAKEN: T.S. Eliot's poem title this "land" comes from Jessie L. Weston's "From Ritual to Romance"
The Waste Land
The work is notable for being mentioned by T. S. Eliot in the notes to his poem, The Waste Land:  Weston's book is an academic examination of the roots of the King Arthur legends and seeks to make connections between the early pagan elements and the later Christian influences.
3
The book's main focus is on the Holy Grail tradition and its influence, particularly the Wasteland motif.
The origins of Weston's book are in James George Frazer's seminal work on folklore, magic and religion, The Golden Bough (1890), and in the works of Jane Ellen Harrison.
Trivia The book appears in the film Apocalypse Now (1979), among those kept by the character, Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando, along with The Golden Bough.

Downs became a bona fide television "personality" as Jack Paar's announcer on The Tonight Show from mid-1957, when he replaced Franklin Pangborn, until Paar's departure in March 1962, and then continued to announce for "The Tonight Show" until the fall of 1962, when Ed Herlihy took the announcing reins.
Downs has been seen in infomercials for Bottom Line Publications, including their World's Greatest Treasury of Health Secrets, as well as another one for a personal coach.
On his last 20/20 he was asked if he had any opinions of his own that he would like to express: he responded that marijuana should be legalized.

ACTORS OF THE PAST: Italian actress Eleonora Duse was famous for her roles in this Norwegian's plays

While she made her career and fame performing in the theatrical "warhorses" of her day, she is today remembered more for her association with the plays of Gabriele d'Annunzio and Henrik Ibsen.

EXPLORING AFRICA: In the late 1790s Friedrich Hornemann became the first modern European to cross this desert
Sahara
In Murzuk Hornemann had collected a great deal of trustworthy information concerning the peoples and countries of the western Sahara and central Sudan, and when he left Tripoli it was his intention to go directly to the Hausa country, which region he was the first European definitely to locate.

The African Association sent him to the University of Göttingen to study Arabic and otherwise prepare for an expedition from the east into the unknown regions of North Africa.
Here Hornemann lived until June 1799, going thence to the city of Tripoli, whence in August of the same year he despatched his journals to London.
A French translation of the English work, made by order of the First Consuls and augmented with notes and a memoir on the Egyptian oases by L. Langlès, was published in Paris in the following year.
