"Z" END: Famous nickname of Walter Mondale
Fritz
Walter Frederick "Fritz" Mondale (born January 5, 1928) is an American Democratic Party politician who served as the 42nd Vice President of the United States (1977–81) under President Jimmy Carter, and as a United States Senator from Minnesota (1964–76).

Mondale spoke before the Senate on September 4, 2002, when he delivered a lecture on his service, with commentary on the transformation of the office of the Vice President during the Carter administration, the Senate cloture rule for ending debate, and his view on the future of the Senate in U.S. political history.
He is also a former Minnesota state senator.

In October 2012, it was announced that Woods had signed an exclusive endorsement deal with Fuse Science, Inc, a sports nutrition firm.
Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a "superstar" competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort.

HISTORY: In 333 B.C. this leader defeated Darius III, king of Persia, at Issus in Syria but was unable to capture him
Alexander the Great
In 334 BC, Alexander the Great began his invasion of the Persian Empire and subsequently defeated the Persians in a number of battles before looting and destroying the capital Persepolis, by fire, in 331 BC. With the Persian Empire now effectively under Alexander's control, Alexander then decided to pursue Darius.
3
It is told by Arrian that at the Battle of Issus the moment the Persian left went to pieces under Alexander’s attack and Darius, in his war-chariot, saw that it was cut off, he incontinently fled – indeed, he led the race for safety.
He led his army through the Caspian Gates, the main road through the mountains that would work to slow a following army.

ANCIENT "P"LACES: The Bible calls Canaan this "land", a name you won't find on any map
the Promised Land
In the Bible, the renaming of Land of Canaan as the Land of Israel marks the Israelite conquest of the Promised Land.

Etymology  thumb|250px|Map of the Near East by Robert de Vaugondy (1762), indicating Canaan as limited to the Holy Land, to the exclusion of Lebanon and Syria The English term Canaan (pronounced  since c. AD 1500, due to the Great Vowel Shift) comes from the Hebrew  (knʿn), via Greek  Khanaan and Latin .
Yahweh and Other Deities of Ancient Israel states, <blockquote>"Despite the long regnant model that the Canaanites and Israelites were people of fundamentally different culture, archaeological data now casts doubt on this view.
It has been suggested that the Patriarchal tales of the Bible reflect such social forms.

Though taxing of his time, energy, and emotional state, the McCarthy probes did not seriously affect Copland's career and international artistic reputation.
Despite using folk themes as a tool for signifying Americanness, Copland continued to find "freshness" in Stravinsky's work—especially in his usage of rhythm.
It freshened up one's technique and one's approach." He liked the fact that the practice forced him to "unconventionalize his thinking with respect to chordal structure" and freshened "his melodic and figurational imagination." It fulfilled Copland's need for "more chords," as he phrased it to Bernstein and what Taruskin calls a renewal of his "technical or stylistic resources." As he later maintained in an interview, Copland attempted "to do my own thing using an extended language." Throughout his career, he had been open to incorporating different musical styles into his music, such as jazz and folk music.

ANNUAL EVENTS: The first large balloon to float along in this fall event was Felix the Cat in 1927
Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade
His image could be seen on clocks (not to be confused with the Kit-Cat Klock), Christmas ornaments, and as the first giant balloon ever made for Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade (which flew away and popped after the parade).

The anthropomorphic black cat with his black body, white eyes, and giant grin, coupled with the surrealism of the situations in which his cartoons place him, combine to make Felix one of the most recognized cartoon characters in film history.
Felix's expressive tail, which could be a shovel one moment, an exclamation mark or pencil the next, serves to emphasize that anything can happen in his world.
Like the Van Beuren studio before, Oriolo gave Felix a more domesticated and pedestrian personality, geared more toward children, and introduced now-familiar elements such as Felix's Magic Bag of Tricks, a satchel that could assume the shape and characteristics of anything Felix wanted.

NAME THAT TOON: Until his death in 1959, Arthur Q. Bryan was the voice of this "Wabbit Hunter"
Elmer Fudd
Arthur Quirk Bryan (May 8, 1899 – November 18, 1959) was an American actor, voice actor, comedian and radio personality, remembered best for his longtime recurring role as well-spoken, wisecracking Dr. Gamble on the radio comedy Fibber McGee and Molly and for creating the voice of the Warner Brothers cartoon character Elmer Fudd.
3
He grew up with a deep desire to go into show business, stumbling through the industry for several years before finding steady if unsatisfying work as a bit player and occasional film narrator in Hollywood.
Although his first forays into that medium were accompanied by instructions that he use the Fudd voice, Bryan soon came to the attention of Don Quinn and Phil Leslie, the production and writing team responsible for Fibber McGee and Molly and their supporting characters, two of whom spun off into their own radio hits, The Great Gildersleeve and Beulah.
On Fibber, Bryan found himself in the unusual position of being smarter than, more educated than, and generally superior to his foil, titular braggart McGee.

[[User:KHM03|KHM03]] 17:00, 17 January 2006 (UTC)   One could just as well argue that those Roman Christians shouldn't call themselves Catholic either, since they, ahem, left (or cut off) the Catholic Church in the eleventh century.
But if there is any need for disambigulation, then Roman Catholic is used to indicate the section of Catholicism in communion with the Pope. ''Roman Catholic'' is not an invention of Wikipedia.
I seriously doubt that the Oriental Orthodox and Church of the East see themselves as part of some vague Nicean communion either, so I've broken them out into another section, but not being expert on these churches, I don't know what further to say.

TOUCH-TONE TELEPHONE TUNES: Also known as "Old Folks at Home", this song was composed in 1851:
"Suwannee River"
"Old Folks at Home" (also known as "Swanee River", "Swanee Ribber" [from the original lyrics], or "Suwannee River") is a minstrel song written by Stephen Foster in 1851.
3
Antonín Dvořák's Humoresque No. 7, written in the 1890s, is musically similar and is sometimes played along with "Old Folks at Home."
The mid-19th-century sheet music cover, pictured here, promotes the song as an "Ethiopian melody."  A word now long reckoned to be an ethnic slur, "darkies," used in Foster's lyrics,  has become such an embarrassment for singers and audiences alike that, for example, the word "brothers" was sung in place of the offensive word at the dedication of the new Florida state capitol building in 1978.
