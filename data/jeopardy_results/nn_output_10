BIBLICAL GUYS: Belshazzar's wise men couldn't explain the handwriting on the wall, but he could
Daniel
Belshazzar (; Biblical Hebrew בלשאצר; Akkadian: Bēl-šarra-uṣur; Greek: Balthazar, from Akkadian, meaning "Protect His Life"; or, possibly, "[May] Bel Protect the King";) was Coregent of Babylon, governing the country after his father, King Nabonidus, went into exile in 550 BCE. Belshazzar died after Babylon fell to the Persians in 539 BCE.  According to the Book of Daniel, Belshazzar holds a last great feast at which he sees a hand writing on a wall with the Aramaic words mene, mene, tekel, upharsin, which Daniel interprets as a judgment from God foretelling the fall of Babylon.

When speaking in English, only pedants insist that "American" is not specific enough, when the reality is that everyone knows what you mean by "American" since there is only one country in the two American continents that includes "America" in the name (and in English too).
However, I would object to the substitution thrroughout Wikipedia of Anglo-Saxon for English-speaking or anglophone (which in turn is a term Canadians have adopted a posterior usage for).
I can see the possibility of United States being an acceptable adjective for something associated with the government, as are the examples you gave.
