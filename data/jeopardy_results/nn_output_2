The Hound of the Baskervilles

Jon Stewart
The Daily Show (also known as The Daily Show with Jon Stewart from 1999 until 2015, and The Daily Show with Trevor Noah as of 2015) is an American late-night talk and news satire television program, which airs each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central and, in Canada, The Comedy Network.

During Stewart's tenure, the show typically opened with a long monologue, relating to recent headlines and frequently featured exchanges with one or more of several correspondents, who adopted absurd or humorously exaggerated takes on current events against Stewart's straight man persona.
During the 2000, 2004, and 2008 presidential elections, the show went on the road to record week-long specials from the cities hosting the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.
In 2010, Winstead had changed her views, commenting that since 2004, Stewart did some of the hardest-hitting interviews on TV.  Stewart said in 2003 that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects the idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer.

As for American as now defined being offensive to neighbouring countries, I've already explained that the replacement you propose would be offensive to a neighbouring country (Canada) but apparently Canadians' feelings don't count, eh?
This is why you have Columbia Pictures and CBS  Personally I think everything should say USA to be absolutely clear.
FIRST DATES: The U.S. signed its first international treaty Feb. 6, 1778 with this country

I agree with you that Canada is a specific case; the culture of Canada has evolved in such a way that it mixes cultures of both France and Great Britain, thus making a unique culture.

I agree both are correct, but U.S. is more precise.
And if you want me to use Portuguese and Spanish definitions of adjectives, why not want me to use gendered articles?

According to Edith, Archie's resentment of Mike stemmed primarily from the fact that Mike was attending college, while Archie had been forced to drop out of high school during the Great Depression to help support his family.

LITERARY PLACES: After "Heart of Darkness", he wrote "Nostromo" about the imaginary country of Costaguana
Joseph Conrad
Nostromo (full title Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard) is a 1904 novel by Joseph Conrad, set in the fictitious South American republic of "Costaguana".
3
Plot summary Nostromo is set in the South American country of Costaguana, and more specifically in that country's Occidental Province and its port city of Sulaco.
He is, however, never admitted to become a part of upper-class society, but is instead viewed by the rich as their useful tool.
Marlon Brando, Paul Scofield, Peter O'Toole, Isabella Rossellini, Christopher Lambert, and Dennis Quaid had all been set to star in this adaptation.
FILM & TV SPACESHIPS: In this 1979 film, the mining ship Nostromo lands on a distant planet to investigate a suspected S.O.S.
Alien
In Ridley Scott's Alien the spacecraft is named the Nostromo; the escape vessel is also named Narcissus, an allusion to another of Conrad's works, The Nigger of the Narcissus.
3
The book has more fully developed characters than any other of his novels, but two characters dominate the narrative: Señor Gould and the eponymous anti-hero, the "incorruptible" Nostromo.
Though Costaguana is a fictional nation, its geography as described in the book resembles real-life Colombia.
He finds himself becoming a slave of the silver and its secret, even as he slowly recovers it ingot by ingot during nighttime trips to Great Isabel.

CELEBRITY QUOTES: According to Leo Durocher, it's where "Nice Guys Finish"
Last
Joe Niese, Burleigh Grimes: Baseball's Last Legal Spitballer, 2013, page 189  Durocher was a favorite of Yankee manager Miller Huggins, who saw in him the seeds of a great manager—the competitiveness, the passion, the ego, the facility for remembering situations.

The two were a successful and combustible combination.
The actual quotations (recollected 29 years after the fact) are incorrect, as they are contradicted by the contemporary records (see references above), but show Durocher's philosophy, as epitomized in this maxim of his.
In a mid-July series against the Mets, the Cubs were beaten in the first two games at Shea Stadium, but finally managed to salvage the third game, after which Durocher was asked if those were the real Cubs.
