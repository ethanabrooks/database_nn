ASTRONOMY: Representing a crab, it's the faintest of all the Zodiac's constellations
Cancer
The division of the ecliptic into the zodiacal signs originates in Babylonian ("Chaldean") astronomy during the first half of the 1st millennium BC, likely during Median/"Neo-Babylonian" times (7th century BC).Powell 2004 The classical zodiac is a modification of the MUL.APIN catalogue, which was compiled around 1000 BC. Some of the constellations can be traced even further back, to Bronze Age (Old Babylonian) sources,  including Gemini "The Twins", from MAŠ.TAB.BA.GAL.GAL "The Great Twins", and Cancer "The Crab", from AL.LUL "The Crayfish", among others.
3
The Babylonian calendar as it stood in the 7th century BC assigned each month to a sign, beginning with the position of the Sun at vernal equinox, which, at the time, was depicted as the Aries constellation ("Age of Aries"), for which reason the first sign is still called "Aries" even after the vernal equinox has moved away from the Aries constellation due to the slow precession of the Earth's axis of rotation.

The Oracle of Amun proclaimed that it was the will of Amun that Hatshepsut be pharaoh, further strengthening her position.
Biographer Evelyn Wells, however, accepts Hatshepsut's claim that she was her father's intended successor.
Had that been true, as head of the army, in a position given to him by Hatshepsut (who was clearly not worried about her co-regent's loyalty), he surely could have led a successful coup, but he made no attempt to challenge her authority during her reign and, her accomplishments and images remained featured on all of the public buildings she built for twenty years after her death.

LANGUAGES: The ancient philosophical texts known as the Upanishads were written in this classical language
Sanskrit
Etymology The Sanskrit term  (u = at, pa = foot, nishat =sitting down) translates to "sitting at the foot/feet of", referring to the student sitting down near the teacher while receiving esoteric knowledge.
3
All these Upanisads were composed probably in the last few centuries BCE.Patrick Olivelle, Upanishads, Encyclopedia Britannica  The two late prose Upanisads, the Prasna and the Mandukya, cannot be much older than the beginning of the common era.
These lists associated each Upanishad with one of the four Vedas, many such lists exist, and these lists are inconsistent across India in terms of which Upanishads are included and how the newer Upanishads are assigned to the ancient Vedas.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan states that the Upanishads have dominated Indian philosophy, religion and life ever since their appearance.

In the early 1800s, the English became concerned with the beauty of dogs rather than their function.
" The AKC differed from The Kennel Club in that individuals could not directly join the Kennel Club; they became members of smaller, individual breed clubs, which were themselves members of the AKC. When arguments began to develop between the American and Canadian breed clubs in 1886, the Canadian clubs pulled out from the organization and established their own kennel club two years later, the Canadian Kennel Club.

ROMANS: The Romans celebrated Anna Perenna, sort of a New Year's Day festival, on the 15th or ides of this month
March
Her festival fell on the Ides of March (March 15), which would have marked the first full moon in the year in the old lunar Roman calendar when March was reckoned as the first month of the year, and was held at the grove of the goddess at the first milestone on the Via Flaminia.

Origin Ovid reports a legend that Anna Perenna was the Anna who appears as Dido's sister in Virgil's Aeneid, later cast away in Italy, who became drowned near Aeneas' settlement of Lavinium, but was transformed into a river nymph hidden in the "perennial stream" (amnis perennis) of Numicus and renamed Anna Perenna, at which news people celebrated with outdoor revels.
Franz Altheim, an authority on Roman religion,Römische Religionsgeschichte. 3 Bände. de Gruyter, Berlin 1931–1933 suggests that Anna Perenna was originally an Etruscan mother goddess, and that her relationship with Aeneas was developed to strengthen her association with Rome.

Reception  In The New York Times, Larry McMurtry says, "Tyler shows, with a fine clarity, the mingling of misery and contentment in the daily lives of her families, reminds us how alike--and yet distinct--happy and unhappy families can be.
Michiko Kakutani wrote, "It is from just such private lives that Miss Tyler herself has spun her own minutely detailed art, rendering them with such warmth and fidelity that her readers, too, are startled into a new appreciation of the ordinary and mundane.
Chicago Tribune  Edward Hoagland wrote in the New York Times,"Macon Leary, the magnificently decent yet ordinary man in The Accidental Tourist, follows logic to its zany conclusions, and in doing this justifies...the catch-as-catch-can nature of much of life, making us realize that we are probably missing people of mild temperament in our own acquaintance who are heroes, too, if we had Ms. Tyler's eye for recognizing them....Muriel, the man-chaser and man-saver of The Accidental Tourist, ranks among the more endearing characters of postwar literature."Hoagland, Edward (September 11, 1988) "

Star Trek
In the Star Trek science-fiction franchise, the Bajorans are a humanoid extraterrestrial species native to the planet Bajor.

The Federation could not intervene in the situation, due to Prime Directive considerations; since Bajor had formally aligned itself with the Cardassians some time before, it was considered an internal matter between the Cardassian Union and a member/subject planet.
Culture and traditions  Bajoran tradition places the family name before the given name; thus, 'Kira Nerys' is properly addressed as 'Major Kira', not 'Major Nerys'.
In similarity to Christianity, the non-canon Deep Space Nine Relaunch novels reveal the existence of a form of 'excommunication' from the Bajoran faith: when Kira Nerys interferes in a growing civil war, despite being ordered not to do so by the Vedek Assembly, she is declared 'Attainted' and can no longer attend Bajoran services, set foot in a temple, or study from an Orb or the Bajoran sacred texts.

THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE: Jefferson's draft was influenced by "Two Treatises of Government", a 1690 book by this English philosopher
John Locke
The Latter Is an Essay Concerning The True Original, Extent, and End of Civil Government) is a work of political philosophy published anonymously in 1689 by John Locke.
3
Locke intimates in the First Treatise that the doctrine of divine right of kings (jure divino) will eventually be the downfall of all governments.
This makes him willing to quit a condition, which, however free, is full of fears and continual dangers: and it is not without reason, that he seeks out, and is willing to join in society with others, who are already united, or have a mind to unite, for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties and estates, which I call by the general name, property.
Ashcraft’s Locke takes the side of the burgeoning merchant class against the aristocracy.

SHOTS HEARD AROUND THE WORLD: His "called shot" home run off Charlie Root in the 1932 World Series is baseball legend
Babe Ruth
On October 1, 1932, he threw the pitch that Babe Ruth allegedly predicted he would hit into the seats in the 1932 World Series at Wrigley Field in Chicago (see: Babe Ruth's called shot).

As quoted by Baseball Legends: The Charlie Root Story, by Joseph E. Bennett, Jan. 1995 Knight Templar magazine "Root was one of the fiercest competitors the game ever knew... his cigar-chomping, no-nonsense visage was one of the most intimidating tools in his baseball arsenal."
According to his daughter Della, two days before his death he told her, "I gave my life to baseball, and I'll only be remembered for something that never happened".
SILENT MOVIES: This 1903 Edwin S. Porter classic wasn't filmed in the Wild West but in the wilds of New Jersey
The Great Train Robbery
Of over 250 films created by Porter, his most important include Jack and the Beanstalk (1902), Life of an American Fireman (1903), The Great Train Robbery (1903), The Kleptomaniac (1905), Life of a Cowboy (1906), Rescued from an Eagle's Nest (1908), and The Prisoner of Zenda (1913) .
3
Eventually becoming a merchant tailor, Porter was battered by the 1893 financial panic.
Between 1903 and 1905 he successfully demonstrated most of the techniques that were to become the basic modes of visual communication through film.
For instance, he helped to develop the modern concept of continuity editing, and is often credited with discovering that the basic unit of structure in film was the "shot" rather than the scene (the basic unit on the stage), paving the way for D.W. Griffith's advances in editing and screen storytelling.
