A VIRGIL VIGIL: Scholars have used Virgil's fourth "Eclogue" as proof that a pagan Roman had foretold of this person's birth
Jesus Christ
Partially as a result of his so-called "Messianic" Fourth Eclogue—widely interpreted later to have predicted the birth of Jesus Christ—Virgil was in later antiquity imputed to have the magical abilities of a seer; the Sortes Vergilianae, the process of using Virgil's poetry as a tool of divination, is found in the time of Hadrian, and continued into the Middle Ages.

lexicographer
Samuel Johnson (18 September 1709  – 13 December 1784), often referred to as Dr Johnson, was an English writer who made lasting contributions to English literature as a poet, essayist, moralist, literary critic, biographer, editor and lexicographer.

Writer and printer Samuel Richardson, enjoying the essays greatly, questioned the publisher as to who wrote the works; only he and a few of Johnson's friends were told of Johnson's authorship.
However, Johnson did not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeare's faults, including his lack of morality, his vulgarity, his carelessness in crafting plots, and his occasional inattentiveness when choosing words or word order.

MUSIC: It's the instrument associated with Jean-Pierre Rampal
the flute
He has been personally "credited with returning to the flute the popularity as a solo classical instrument it had not held since the 18th century."  Biography  Early years Born in Marseille, the only child of Andrée (née Roggero) and flautist Joseph Rampal, Jean-Pierre Rampal became the first exponent of the solo flute in modern times to establish it on the international concert circuit, and to attract acclaim and large audiences comparable to those enjoyed by celebrity singers, pianists, and violinists.
3
As it was unusual for solo flute to be featured widely in orchestral concerts, this was not easily done in the immediate years after World War II; however, Rampal's flair and presence—he was a big man to wield such a slim instrument—paved the way for the next generation of flautist superstars such as James Galway and Emmanuel Pahud.

Also, as early as 1950–51 he became the first to record all six of Vivaldi's Op.10 concertos, an exercise he was to repeat several times in later years.

AUTHORS: This author of "The Moonstone" was named for his father's friend Sir David Wilkie
Wilkie Collins
The Moonstone (1868) by Wilkie Collins is a 19th-century British epistolary novel, generally considered the first detective novel in the English language.
3
Plot summary Colonel Herncastle, an unpleasant former soldier, brings the Moonstone back with him from India where he acquired it by theft and murder during the Siege of Seringapatam.
In despair at her inability to make him acknowledge her despite all she had done for him, she committed suicide, leaving behind the smeared gown and a letter he did not receive at the time because of his hasty departure abroad.
The technique again works to Collins's credit: the sections by Gabriel Betteredge (steward to the Verinder household) and Miss Clack (a poor relative and religious crank) offer both humour and pathos through their contrast with the testimony of other narrators, at the same time as constructing and advancing the novel's plot.

If the founders of the country really did believe that North America was a separate continent, why the h*ll didnt they name the country "United States of North America"???
What Im saying is:  1)Theres a term in english that is offensive to the other countries in the continent of the same name.
When the USA became an independent country, it adopted the official name of "United States of America" (they were states alright; they were united in many aspects; and they were located in America - the continent).

U.S. State Department: The Acheson–Lilienthal & Baruch Plans, 1946  Although the Soviets showed increased interest in the cause of arms control after they became a nuclear power in 1949, and particularly after the death of Stalin in 1953, the issue of the Soviet Union submitting to international inspection was always a thorny one upon which many attempts at nuclear arms control were stalled.
3
The Baruch Plan was a proposal by the United States government, written largely by Bernard Baruch but based on the Acheson–Lilienthal Report, to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC) during its first meeting in June 1946.
Text of plan  The plan proposed to:   extend between all countries the exchange of basic scientific information for peaceful ends;   implement control of nuclear power to the extent necessary to ensure its use only for peaceful purposes;   eliminate from national armaments atomic weapons and all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction; and   establish effective safeguards by way of inspection and other means to protect complying States against the hazards of violations and evasions  Reaction The US agreed to turn over all of its weapons on the condition that all other countries pledge not to produce them and agree to an adequate system of inspection.
Bertrand Russell urged control of nuclear weapons in the 1940s and early 1950s to avoid the likelihood of a general nuclear war, and felt hopeful when the Baruch Proposal was made.
