The fictional Aeneas dutifully resists Dido's temptation and abandons her to forge on to Italy, placing political destiny before romantic love, in stark contrast to Antony, who puts passionate love of his own Egyptian queen, Cleopatra, before duty to Rome.
The straightforwardness of the binary between male Rome and female Egypt has been challenged in later 20th-century criticism of the play: "In the wake of feminist, poststructuralist, and cultural-materialist critiques of gender essentialism, most modern Shakespeare scholars are inclined to be far more skeptical about claims that Shakespeare possessed a unique insight into a timeless 'femininity'." As a result, critics have been much more likely in recent years to describe Cleopatra as a character that confuses or deconstructs gender than as a character that embodies the feminine.
Critics' interpretations of boys portraying female characters  Antony and Cleopatra also contains self-references to the crossdressing as it would have been performed historically on the London stage.

Lee Mendelson, producer of the majority of the Peanuts television specials, has said that "He [Charlie Brown] was, and is, the ultimate survivor in overcoming bulliness—Lucy or otherwise."

An example is a strip from 1951, which features Violet and Patty telling Charlie Brown that they are not going to invite him to their party, with Charlie Brown replying that he does not wish to go their "dumb ol' party" anyway, leading the two girls to invite him.

Programing  BET's programming began with a wide scope of comedy, music, public affairs, and news programming including ComicView, Video Soul with Donnie Simpson, Video Vibrations, Softones, Screen Scene, Unreal/Planet Groove/Caribbean Rhythms, Jam Zone/Cita's World, Teen Summit, BET News with Ed Gordon, Lead Story, BET Tonight with Tavis Smiley, and BET Nightly News.

History of English blank verse Marlowe and then Shakespeare developed its potential greatly in the late 16th century.
(Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey, lines 1-5)  Coleridge's blank verse is more technical than Wordsworth's, but he wrote little of it: Well, they are gone, and here must I remain, This lime-tree bower my prison!
A complete listing is impossible, since a sort of loose blank verse has become a staple of lyric poetry, but it would be safe to say that blank verse is as prominent now as it has been any time in the past three hundred years.

This is exactly my point; The term "Native Americans" is used by residents of North America (perhaps with the exception of Mexico) as a synonim  to "people who inhabited the area that is now USA before the colonization".

As for political correctness, changing English usage because it doesn't conform to usage in other languages is the height of it.
What I said, and repeat, is that, if some language borrows a word from another language and changes its meaning deliberately to something the "original user" consider to be offensive, the borrower is being "inapropiate" (for lack of a better word).
If that is what posterior usage means, then your circular definition of Anglo-Saxon – you say English-speaking countries' cultures are Anglo-Saxon, but your  definition of Anglo-Saxon is "pertaining to the culture of English-speaking countries" – would cause problems for me.

This family has achieved a tolerable modus vivendi by ignoring the skeletons (among the secrets: Gregers' father may have impregnated his servant Gina then married her off to Hjalmar to legitimize the child, and Hjalmar's father has been disgraced and imprisoned for a crime the elder Werle committed.) and by permitting each member to live in a dreamworld of his own—the feckless father believing himself to be a great inventor, the grandfather dwelling on the past when he was a mighty sportsman, and little Hedvig, the child, centering her emotional life around an attic where a wounded wild duck leads a crippled existence in a make-believe forest.

CONTINENTAL DRIFTING: (Jon of the Clue Crew stands in front of an ancient globe) Meaning "all earth", it's the term Alfred Wegener gave to an historic, theoretical supercontinent
Pangaea
In 1915, in The Origin of Continents and Oceans (), Wegener drew together evidence from various fields to advance the theory that there had once been a giant continent which he named ""according to the OED, 2d edition (1989), the word is not found in the 1915 edition of Wegener's text; it appears in the 1920 edition but with no indication that Wegener coined it (German for "primal continent", analogous to the Greek "Pangaea", meaning "All-Lands" or "All-Earth").

His brother Kurt remarked that Alfred Wegener’s motivation was to “reestablish the connection between geophysics on the one hand and geography and geology on the other, which had become completely ruptured because of the specialized development of these branches of science.
Three years later the fourth and final expanded edition of “The Origin of Continents and Oceans” appeared.
The crater Wegener on the Moon and the crater Wegener on Mars, as well as the asteroid 29227 Wegener and the peninsula where he died in Greenland (Wegener Peninsula near Ummannaq, ), are named after him.
