DA BOMB: The A-bomb test site was named this, after the John Donne poem "Batter My Heart, Three-Personed God"
Trinity
In 1962, Donne's works were cited by physicist Robert Oppenheimer as having been the inspiration for choosing the code name "Trinity" for the first nuclear bomb test, specifically the passage As West and East In all flatt Maps—and I am one—are one, So death doth touch the Resurrection.
3
Donne did not return to England until 1620.
The William Styron novel Set This House on Fire has its title taken from one of Donne's sermons and an excerpt of that same sermon serves as the novel's epigraph.
My world's both parts and, O, both parts must die."
JULIUS CAESAR: Around 48 B.C. Caesar pardoned this man & later made him governor of Cisalpine Gaul; oops
Brutus
44 BC, Caesar was assassinated by a group of rebellious senators led by Marcus Junius Brutus.
3
He turned to Marcus Licinius Crassus, one of Rome's richest men.
Shortly before his assassination, the Senate named him censor for life and Father of the Fatherland, and the month of Quintilis was renamed July in his honor.
Suetonius, Julius 49; Cassius Dio, Roman History 43.20 This form of slander was popular during this time in the Roman Republic to demean and discredit political opponents.

– 15 March 44 BC)After Caesar's death the leap years were not inserted according to his intent and there is uncertainty about when leap years were observed between 45 BC and AD 4 inclusive; the dates in this article between 45 BC and AD 4 inclusive are those observed in Rome and there is an uncertainty of about a day as to where those dates would be on the proleptic Julian calendar.

With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome.
From the J. C. Rolfe translation of 1914: "...he was stabbed with three and twenty wounds, uttering not a word, but merely a groan at the first stroke, though some have written that when Marcus Brutus rushed at him, he said in Greek, 'You too, my child?".
Both Octavian and Mark Antony promoted the cult of Divus Iulius.
WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA?: In 1826 James Madison succeeded this other former U.S. president as rector of the University of Virginia
Thomas Jefferson
Breaking with Hamilton and the Federalist Party in 1791, he and Thomas Jefferson organized the Democratic-Republican Party.
3
Instead, in 1769 he enrolled at the College of New Jersey, now Princeton University, where he became roommates and close friends with poet Philip Freneau.
If Virginia, the most populous state at the time, did not ratify the Constitution, the new national government would likely not succeed.
He died at Montpelier on June 28, as the last of the Founding Fathers.
HISTORIC NAMES: When Alexander Hamilton & James Monroe nearly met in a duel, this man interceded & defused the situation

BIBLICAL VOICES: This blind father recognized Jacob's voice but thought his goatskin-covered hands were those of Esau
Isaac
He is the son of Isaac and Rebecca, the grandson of Abraham, Sarah and of Bethuel, and the younger twin brother of Esau.

Jacob suggested that all the spotted, speckled, and brown goats and sheep of Laban's flock, at any given moment, would be his wages.
According to the Sages, this was a prophetic reference to the End of Days, when Jacob's descendants will come to Mount Seir, the home of Edom, to deliver judgment against Esau's descendants for persecuting them throughout the millennia (see ).
JACKIE ROBINSON: Jackie played most of his career at this position, next to shortstop Pee Wee Reese
Second Base
Jack Roosevelt "Jackie" Robinson (January 31, 1919 – October 24, 1972) was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) second baseman who became the first African American to play in the major leagues in the modern era.
3
An incident at PJC illustrated Robinson's impatience with authority figures he perceived as racist—a character trait that would resurface repeatedly in his life.
Ultimately, the Dodgers won the National League pennant, but lost in five games to the New York Yankees in the 1949 World Series.
Robinson's daughter, Sharon, became a midwife, educator, director of educational programming for MLB, and the author of two books about her father.

TECH TALK: This device at the government's NIST lab neither gains nor loses a second in 99 million years
the atomic clock
Based on caesium microwave atomic clock With the development of the atomic clock in the early 1960s, it was decided to use atomic time as the basis of the definition of the second, rather than the revolution of the Earth around the Sun.
3
The more common larger non-SI units of time are not formed by powers of ten; instead, the second is multiplied by 60 to form a minute, which is multiplied by 60 to form an hour, which is multiplied by 24 to form a day.
A uniform second was produced by correcting the output of each atomic clock to mean sea level (the rotating geoid), lengthening the second by about 1.
In recent years, optical atomic clocks have become increasingly competitive in performance with their microwave counterparts.
CHRISTIANITY: It can refer to the birth of Christ, his second coming or the 4 Sundays before Christmas
Advent
With the advent of atomic clocks, it became feasible to define the second based on a fundamental property of nature.
3
Thus the sun–earth motion was not considered a suitable basis for the definition.
Thus the second could now be reliably measured.
They found that the second of ephemeris time (ET) had the duration of 9,192,631,770 ± 20 cycles of the chosen caesium frequency.

WORLD LIT: There's no dialogue in this author's novel "The Painted Bird"
Jerzy Kosinski
The Painted Bird is a controversial 1965 novel by Jerzy Kosinski which describes World War II as seen by a boy, considered a "Gypsy or Jewish stray,"  wandering about small towns scattered around Eastern Europe.

When the woman dies, he is left to care for himself.
Kosinski nonetheless continued to assert that characterizing the novel as autobiographical "may be convenient for classification, but is not easily justified" (the same language he used in his author's note and his pre-publication correspondence with de Santillana) in later interviews during his life.

BILL CLINTON'S FAVORITE BOOKS: After some careful thought, "Meditations" by this Roman philosopher & emperor made the list
Marcus Aurelius
Meditations (, literally "[that which is] to himself") is a series of personal writings by Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor from 161 to 180 AD, recording his private notes to himself and ideas on Stoic philosophy.
3
Depending on the English translation, Marcus's style is not viewed as anything regal or belonging to royalty, but rather a man among other men which allows the reader to relate to his wisdom.
As for others whose lives are not so ordered, he reminds himself constantly of the characters they exhibit daily and nightly at home and abroad, and of the sort of society they frequent; and the approval of such men, who do not even stand well in their own eyes has no value for him.
