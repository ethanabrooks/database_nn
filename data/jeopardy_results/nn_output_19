Bryan campaigned tirelessly, championing the ideas of the farmers and workers, using his skills as a famed orator to ultimately reshape the Democratic Party into a more progressive one.

WHERE ART THOU?: The woodcut prints called Ukiyo-e of this Asian country influenced Monet & other Impressionists

left|thumb|alt=A black-and-white illustration of a pair of lovers in splendid dress at play.|Early woodblock print, Hishikawa Moronobu, late 1670s or early 1680s  In response to the increasing demand for ukiyo-e works, Hishikawa Moronobu (1618–1694) produced the first ukiyo-e woodblock prints.
Utamaro was particularly contentious, seen by Fenollosa and others as a degenerate symbol of ukiyo-e's decline; Utamaro has since been generally accepted as one of the form's greatest masters.
Editions made from recut woodblocks also circulate, such as legitimate later reproductions, as well as pirate editions and other fakes.

This flame provides sufficient heat to keep the candle burning via a self-sustaining chain of events: the heat of the flame melts the top of the mass of solid fuel; the liquefied fuel then moves upward through the wick via capillary action; the liquefied fuel finally vaporizes to burn within the candle's flame.

HISTORIC AMERICANS: General Winfield Scott called him "the very best soldier I ever saw in the field"
Robert E. Lee
Military campaigns Landing at Veracruz on March 9, 1847, Scott, assisted by one of his staff officers, Captain Robert E. Lee, and perhaps inspired by William H. Prescott's History of the Conquest of Mexico, followed the approximate route taken by Hernán Cortés in 1519, and assaulted Mexico City.

As commanding general of the Army, Scott took great interest in the professional development of the cadets of the United States Military Academy.

BIBLICAL QUOTES: These 4 words were the handwriting Belshazzar saw on the wall of his palace
mene, mene, tekel, upharsin
Belshazzar (; Biblical Hebrew בלשאצר; Akkadian: Bēl-šarra-uṣur; Greek: Balthazar, from Akkadian, meaning "Protect His Life"; or, possibly, "[May] Bel Protect the King";) was Coregent of Babylon, governing the country after his father, King Nabonidus, went into exile in 550 BCE. Belshazzar died after Babylon fell to the Persians in 539 BCE.  According to the Book of Daniel, Belshazzar holds a last great feast at which he sees a hand writing on a wall with the Aramaic words mene, mene, tekel, upharsin, which Daniel interprets as a judgment from God foretelling the fall of Babylon.

TELEVISION: "Matlock" & "Designing Women" were both set in this state capital
Atlanta
The comedy series Designing Women was a joint production of Bloodworth/Thomason Mozark Productions in association with Columbia Pictures Television for CBS.  The series centers on the lives of four women and one man working together at an interior designing firm in Atlanta, Georgia called Sugarbakers & Associates.

Although it was a traditional comedy, and often included broad physical comedy, Designing Women was very topical (particularly in episodes written by Bloodworth-Thomason herself), and featured discussions of controversial topics such as homophobia, racism, dating clergy, AIDS, hostile societal attitudes towards the overweight, and spousal abuse.
Julia also expresses her admiration for former president Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, and is very upset in the episode, "Miss Trial", when her service for jury duty prevents her from attending a dinner with the Carters, who, like her, volunteer for Habitat for Humanity.
Only a few weeks into the show's seventh season on the "Friday night death slot", despite receiving no competition from the other networks, the series had drastically slipped from 6th to 67th place in the Nielsen ratings.

According to journalism professor Ben Yagoda, Wolfe is also responsible for the use of the present tense in magazine profile pieces; before he began doing so in the early 1960s, profile articles had always been written in the past tense.

Dashiell Hammett
Hellman was romantically involved with fellow writer and political activist Dashiell Hammett, author of the classic detective novels The Maltese Falcon and The Thin Man, who also was blacklisted for 10 years until his death in 1961.

It was revealed that Hellman's popular memoirs such as Pentimento were rife with errors, but that the "Julia" section of Pentimento, which had been the basis for the Oscar-winning 1977 movie of the same name, likely was a fabrication based on the life of Muriel Gardiner.

His reputation became entangled in the larger controversies over the effectiveness of the UN and the role of the United States in the UN.  Some Somalis believed he was responsible for an escalation of the Somalia crisis by undertaking a personal vendetta against Mohamed Farrah Aidid and his Habr Gidr clan, favouring their rivals, the Darod, clan of the former dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.
Meisler instead suggests that Clinton sought to veto Boutros Ghali's second term to increase his own popularity, as Senator Bob Dole, who was running against Clinton in 1996, had gotten a few votes by repeatedly denouncing Boutros-Ghali vehemently.

Starting with the 1999 season, the Fiesta Bowl began hosting the Big 12 Conference champion in years when it was not slated as the BCS title game, an arrangement that continued to the end of the BCS era.
It has been called one of the greatest college football games ever played, due to the combination of an underdog team, trick plays, comebacks by each team, and a thrilling overtime finish.

Programs such as Aladdin, which had been developed earlier by an independent developer and eventually supported by GEnie, helped many of the newcomers who came to GEnie from Prodigy and AOL adjust; these were the equivalent of modern-day email programs and newsreaders, incorporating a more user-friendly interface which automated message and mail downloading and posting.

WORLD HISTORY: In 1455 Johann Fust won a judgment against this printer & took the type used to print his famous Bible
Johannes Gutenberg
Fust loaned 800 guilders (with an interest of 6%) to Johannes Gutenberg with which to start his original project.

After several of Gutenberg’s bibles were sold to King Louis XI of France, it was decided that Fust was performing witchcraft.
Parisians figured that the devil had something to do with the making of these copies, and Fust was thrown into jail on charges of black magic.
The adverse reaction it depicts should not be taken as typical; many early references were at first ambivalent.

LIFE SCIENCE: A week or two after the bite of an Anopheles mosquito, this disease's symptoms may appear
malaria
About 460 species are recognised; while over 100 can transmit human malaria, only 30–40 commonly transmit parasites of the genus Plasmodium, which cause malaria in humans in endemic areas.
2

This technique brings hope, as female mosquitoes only mate once during their lifetimes, and in doing so with sterile male mosquitoes, the insect population would decrease.

mosquito
Anopheles  (Greek anofelís: "useless") is a genus of mosquito first described and named by J. W. Meigen in 1818.Meigen, J. W. (1818).

There is also variation within species.
Though the World Health Organization adopted a formal policy on the control and eradication of the malaria parasite since 1955, only recently, after the Gates Malaria Forum in October 2007, did key organizations start the debate on the pros and cons of redefining eradication as a goal to control malaria.
In the second, while again the oral route is the usual route of infection, the parasite is ingested within an already infected intermediate host.
