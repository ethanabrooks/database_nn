MYTHOLOGY: When this Greek god came to Delphi, he killed a dragon named Python
Apollo
Graves, Robert (1993), "The Greek Myths: Complete Edition" (Penguin, Harmondsworth)  Earlier myths include traditions that Pythia, or the Delphic oracle, already was the site of an important oracle in the pre-classical Greek world (as early as 1400 BC) and, rededicated from about 800 BC, when it served as the major site during classical times for the worship of the god Apollo.

H.W. Parke writes that the foundation of Delphi and its oracle took place before recorded history and its origins are obscure, but dating to the worship of Gaia.
The Homeric Hymn, as we saw, implied that the method of prophecy used there was similar to that of Dodona: both Aeschylus and Euripides, writing in the fifth century, attribute to primeval times the same methods as used at Delphi in their own day.

According to his reading of the painting, the scene was inspired by the text in a Homeric hymn published in Florence in 1488 by the Greek refugee Demetrios Chalkokondyles:  Of august gold-wreathed and beautiful Aphrodite I shall sing to whose domain belong the battlements of all sea-loved Cyprus where, blown by the moist breath of Zephyros, she was carried over the waves of the resounding sea on soft foam.
Viewed from a religious standpoint, the nudity of Venus suggests that of Eve before the Fall as well as the pure love of Paradise.
Since classical antiquity, the sea shell has been a metaphor for a woman's vulva.

The name "United States of Mexico" has been mostly droped in Mexico and at some points the Mexican Legislative Power has considered changing the Official name to Mexico ONLY. I do not know a single mexican that considers himslef a national of the US just because the official name is "Estados Unidos Mexicanos".

What Im saying is that, the term should include all inhabitants of the continent America.
Im not entering the grounds of saying that the Celts and Normans on Canada were those of the single Anglo-saxon tribe (as there are some the defend this); but that a fraction of this unique culture that Canada has is a heritage of anlgo-saxonic culture.

jukebox
As technology evolved, Wurlitzer began producing electric pianos, electronic organs, and jukeboxes and eventually became known more for jukeboxes and vending machines, which are still made by Wurlitzer, than for actual musical instruments.

Wurlitzer's success was due to a first rate marketing department (headed by future Indiana Senator Homer Capehart), the reliable Simplex record changer, and the designs of engineer Paul Fuller who created many cabinet styles in the "lightup" design idiom.
