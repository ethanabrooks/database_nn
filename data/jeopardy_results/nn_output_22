In set theory, which is capable of acting as an axiomatic foundation for modern mathematics, natural numbers can be represented by classes of equivalent sets.
This is often indicated by rounding or truncating a decimal, so that digits that suggest a greater accuracy than the measurement itself are removed.
This led to expressions involving the square roots of negative numbers, and eventually to the definition of a new number: a square root of −1, denoted by i, a symbol assigned by Leonhard Euler, and called the imaginary unit.
NUMBER, PLEASE: The third smallest prime number

The number five can be represented by digit "5" or by the Roman numeral "".

MOVIE LOCATIONS: (Sofia of the Clue Crew in Berlin)  The opening credits of this 1965 Richard Burton Cold War drama unspooled here at Checkpoint Charlie
The Spy Who Came in from the Cold

In Jewish Hebrew, the Samaritans are called Shomronim, while in Samaritan Hebrew they call themselves Shamerim.
In 120 BCE the Hasmonean king Yohanan Hyrcanos I destroyed the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim, due to the resentment between the two groups over a disagreement of whether Mount Moriah in Jerusalem or Mount Gerizim in Shechem was the actual site of the Aqedah, and the chosen place for the Holy Temple, a source of contention that had been growing since the two houses of the former united monarchy first split asunder in 930 BCE and which had finally exploded into warfare.http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/arc/neapolis/samaritantemple.htm 190 years after the destruction of the Samaritan Temple and the surrounding area of Shechem, the Roman emperor Titus launched a military campaign to crush the Jewish revolt of 66 CE, which resulted in the destruction of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE, and the subsequent exile of Jews from Judea and the Galilee in 135 CE following the Bar Kochba revolt.

Belshazzar (; Biblical Hebrew בלשאצר; Akkadian: Bēl-šarra-uṣur; Greek: Balthazar, from Akkadian, meaning "Protect His Life"; or, possibly, "[May] Bel Protect the King";) was Coregent of Babylon, governing the country after his father, King Nabonidus, went into exile in 550 BCE. Belshazzar died after Babylon fell to the Persians in 539 BCE.  According to the Book of Daniel, Belshazzar holds a last great feast at which he sees a hand writing on a wall with the Aramaic words mene, mene, tekel, upharsin, which Daniel interprets as a judgment from God foretelling the fall of Babylon.

SONG & DANCE MEN: Nickname of tap dancer Bill Robinson, who often acted & sang with Shirley Temple
"Bojangles"
Bill "Bojangles" Robinson (May 25, 1878 – November 25, 1949) was an American tap dancer and actor, the best known and most highly paid African American entertainer in the first half of the twentieth century.
3
His signature routine was the stair dance, in which Robinson would tap up and down a set of stairs in a rhythmically complex sequence of steps, a routine that he unsuccessfully attempted to patent.
In his public life Robinson led efforts to:  persuade the Dallas police department to hire its first African American policemen  lobby President Roosevelt during World War II for more equitable treatment of African American soldiers  stage the first integrated public event in Miami, a fundraiser which, with the permission of the mayor, was attended by both black and white city residents  Despite being the highest-paid black performer of the era, Robinson died penniless in 1949, and his funeral was paid for by longtime friend Ed Sullivan.
Robinson had done many such races (including a race in which he set the world record for running backwards) and did not view them as undignified.

If anything, I've found that "people" tend to write sloppily and don't pay much attention to how their text sounds to someone who didn't write it (i.e., everyone else).
