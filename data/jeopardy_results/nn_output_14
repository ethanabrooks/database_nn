AMERICAN HISTORY: Andrew Jackson was one of the landowners who founded this Tennessee town overlooking the Mississippi in 1819
Memphis
Land speculation and founding of Memphis  In 1794, Jackson formed a business with John Overton "for the purpose of purchasing lands as well those lands without as within military bounds"—overtly buying and selling land which had been reserved by treaty for the Cherokee and Chickasaw.

Jackson believed that the president's authority was derived from the people and the presidential office was above party politics.
By the Spring of 1831, only Barry remained, while the rest of Jackson's cabinet had been discharged.
Jackson also denied the right of secession: "The Constitution ... forms a government not a league ... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation."Syrett, 36.
AMERICAN HISTORY: In 1824 Andrew Jackson received more popular & electoral votes, but the House declared this man president
John Quincy Adams
He narrowly lost to John Quincy Adams, supposedly by a "corrupt bargain" between Adams and Speaker of the House Henry Clay, who was also a candidate.

Occurring at the same time as the War of 1812, the Creek campaign saw Jackson command the U.S. forces, which included the Tennessee militia, U.S. regulars, and Cherokee, Choctaw, and Lower Creek warriors.
On May 1, 1833, Jackson wrote, "the tariff was only the pretext, and disunion and southern confederacy the real object.
The Jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children.
FIRST DATES: On Dec. 28, 1832 Andrew Jackson said John C. ya later to this man, the first vice president to resign

One reason for the expansion of Afrikaans is its development in the public realm: it is used in newspapers, radio programs, TV, and several translations of the  Bible have been published since the first one was completed in 1933.
Indeed, there is a groundswell movement within Afrikaans to be inclusive, and to promote itself along with the other indigenous official languages.
Consequently, Afrikaans is commonly denoted as "Zuid-Afrikaans".

Christians designate Jesus as Christ because they believe he is the awaited Messiah prophesied in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament).
The three Synoptic Gospels indicate that Simon of Cyrene assists him, having been compelled by the Romans to do so.
In the 19th century, Nietzsche was highly critical of Jesus, whose teachings he considered to be "anti-nature" in their treatment of topics such as sexuality.
THE BIBLE: In Luke, Jesus is tried both by Herod & by this Roman governor
Pontius Pilate
Most scholars agree that Jesus was a Galilean, Jewish rabbi who preached his message orally, was baptized by John the Baptist, and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate.

According to Matthew and Mark, he refuses it.
Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is possible to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts.
Jewish views   Mainstream Judaism rejects the idea of Jesus being God, or a mediator to God, or part of a Trinity.

An angel announces the birth to some shepherds, who go to Bethlehem to see Jesus, and subsequently spread the news abroad (Luke 2:8–20).
In Mark, John baptizes Jesus, and as he comes out of the water he see the Holy Spirit descending to him like a dove and he hears a voice from heaven declaring him to be God's son (Mark 1:9–11).
In Matthew 27:62–66, on the following day the chief Jewish priests ask Pilate for the tomb to be secured, and with Pilate's permission the priests place seals on the large stone covering the entrance and post a guard.
HE SAID: Jesus was still dripping from this event when a voice from heaven called him "my beloved Son"
baptism
While the flow of some events (such as Jesus' baptism, transfiguration, crucifixion and interactions with the apostles) are shared among the Synoptic Gospels, incidents such as the transfiguration do not appear in John, which also differs on other matters, such as the Cleansing of the Temple.

Luke presents Jesus as the divine-human savior who shows compassion to the needy.
In Mark, they go to the garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus prays to be spared his coming ordeal.

BIBLICAL PEOPLE: The gospel of Matthew says this governor of Judea "washed his hands" of the guilt for crucifying Jesus
Pontius Pilate
Most scholars agree that Jesus was a Galilean, Jewish rabbi who preached his message orally, was baptized by John the Baptist, and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate.

He is the kingly Messiah, referred to repeatedly as "king" and "Son of David." A noteworthy feature of this gospel are the five discourses, collections of teachings on particular themes, including the Sermon on the Mount.
This is one of two events described in the gospels where a voice from Heaven calls Jesus "Son", the other being the Transfiguration.
They may have regarded him as a threat to stability, especially after he caused a disturbance at the Temple.

The screenplay by Michael Gerbosi is based on Robert Graysmith's book The Murder of Bob Crane (1993).

Auto Focus is a 2002 American biographical film directed by Paul Schrader, starring Greg Kinnear and Willem Dafoe.
Mr. Schrader is indifferent to the sinner, but he cannot contain his loathing of the sin, which is not so much sex as the fascination with images ... To argue that images can corrupt the flesh and hollow out the soul is, for a filmmaker, an obviously contradictory exercise, but not necessarily a hypocritical one.

As soon as Piangi slips into a hiding place to await the start of the scene, he is quietly strangled by the Phantom, who takes his place and sings "The Point of No Return" with Christine before declaring his love in front of the whole audience.
