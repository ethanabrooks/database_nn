MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS: Jean-Pierre Rampal was best known for his virtuosity with this instrument
the flute
He has been personally "credited with returning to the flute the popularity as a solo classical instrument it had not held since the 18th century."  Biography  Early years Born in Marseille, the only child of Andrée (née Roggero) and flautist Joseph Rampal, Jean-Pierre Rampal became the first exponent of the solo flute in modern times to establish it on the international concert circuit, and to attract acclaim and large audiences comparable to those enjoyed by celebrity singers, pianists, and violinists.
3
Nevertheless, he was a role model in that he had "definitely established a tradition for the solo flute"; Moyse, Rampal said, "unlocked a door that I continued to push open."  With the war over, Rampal embarked on a series of performances: at first, within France; and then, in 1947, in Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands.
By now, Rampal had America in his sights, and on 14 February 1958 he and  Veyron-Lacroix made their US debut with a recital of Poulenc, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Prokofiev in Washington, D.C. at the Library of Congress.

LITERARY HODGEPODGE: "August 1914" is a novel about the first days of WWI by this author of "The Gulag Archipelago"
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn
The Gulag Archipelago () is a book by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn about the Soviet forced labor camp system.
3
GULag or Gulág is an acronym for the Russian term Glavnoye Upravleniye ispravitelno-trudovyh Lagerey (Главное Управление Исправительно-трудовых Лагерей), or "Chief Administration of Corrective Labour Camps", the bureaucratic name of the governing board of the Soviet labour camp system, and by metonymy, the camp system itself.
While Khrushchev, the Communist Party, and the Soviet Union's supporters in the West viewed the Gulag as a deviation of Stalin, Solzhenitsyn and many among the opposition tended to view it as a systemic fault of Soviet political culture — an inevitable outcome of the Bolshevik political project.
This they achieved after interrogating Elizaveta Voronyanskaya, one of Solzhenitsyn's trusted typists Solzhenitsyn, Literary Giant Who Defied Soviets Dies at 89 who knew where the typed copy was hidden; within days of her release by the KGB she hanged herself (3 August 1973).Thomas, 1998, p. 398.

DOUBLE TALK NAMES: Richard Pryor played this title character in a 1986 film; his life was calling
Jo Jo Dancer
The only film project from this period that recalled his rough roots was Pryor's semi-autobiographic debut as a writer-director, Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling (1986), which was not a major success.

However, the Latin Vulgate Bible translates the passage as it is above, and western Church Fathers therefore tended to refer to Salome as "Herodias's daughter" or just "the girl".
Steven Berkoff filmed his stage version of the play in 1988.
She states that she was "wrapped" in seven veils, and gifted to her Uncle, and that what followed was a "dance of sorts."  Salome by her own description was not a powerful femme fatale, but a powerless pawn and a sexual object, shamelessly exploited by her own family and wielded as a political tool.

What things are in themselves, other than being appearances, as noumenon are not completely knowable by any animal or human mind.
Defining self-consciousness as a determination of the self in time, Kant argues that all determinations of time presuppose something permanent in perception and that this permanence cannot be in the self, since it is only through the permanence that one's existence in time can itself be determined.
The concepts "brown," "wooden," "chair," and so forth are, according to Kant, mediate representations of the chair.

Since dander and many other allergens become trapped in hair, and shed hairs are light enough to spend considerable time airborne indoors before settling to the floor to be removed during housecleaning (an activity which can, ironically, help them stay airborne), shedding of the coat is a typical way in which house-pets spread their allergens in a domestic environment.
Singer Gwen Stefani had a Lhasa Apso dog called Lamb/Meggan.

In France, there have been three further video and DVD adaptations of Volpone based on versions of the Stefan Zweig/Jules Romains script: in 1978, Jean Meyer directed a production in the 'théâtre de boulevard' style for the Théâtre de Marigny and Panorama (Au Théâtre ce soir), starring himself as Corbaccio, Jean Le Poulain as Volpone, Francis Huster as Mosca and Claude Jade as Colomba (Celia).
In 2003, the play was rewritten for television by Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt for a production starring Gérard Depardieu as Volpone and Daniel Prévost as Mosca.

BIBLICAL PEOPLE: According to Mark, he bent to the will of the mob in sending Jesus to the cross
Pontius Pilate
Most scholars agree that Jesus was a Galilean, Jewish rabbi who preached his message orally, was baptized by John the Baptist, and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate.

The four canonical gospels (Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John) are the only substantial sources for the life and message of Jesus.
The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.
The Renaissance brought forth a number of artists who focused on depictions of Jesus; Fra Angelico and others followed Giotto in the systematic development of uncluttered images.
THEN THERE'S MAUVE: The mauve flowers of the Paulownia tree adorn the highest grade of the Order of the Rising Sun award of this country
Japan
They are present in much of China, south to northern Laos and Vietnam and are long cultivated elsewhere in eastern Asia, notably in Japan and Korea (오동나무).

In fact, it is so difficult to start Paulownia by seed that successful plantations purchase rootstock or seedlings—or propagate their own.
More recently, it is used as body material for low-cost electric guitars and as the core for lightweight touring skis.
Some species of plantation Paulownia can be harvested for saw timber in as little as five years.

NEWSPAPERS: U.S. daily nicknamed "The Old Gray Lady"
The New York Times
Wikipedia policy agrees with every notable style manual except the New York Times (which apparently only started printing its manual a few years ago, unlike many others who've been at it for decades or even centuries).
3
One can argue about the order of the two congratulators, and about active vs. passive voice, but the essential difference is using the phrase "committee chairman John Smith" rather than "John Smith, committee chairman" (which introduces the ambiguity of parenthetical commas) or "John Smith, who is committee chairman" (which removes the ambiguity, but is needlessly verbose).
Modern apathy is no reason to abandon these rules wholesale.
For the record, rather than relying on vague assertions of who says what, here's what I found when I recently researched serial commas (which itself is a correct technical term and removes the implication of national usage inherent in calling them "Oxford commas" or "Harvard commas"):  Always use serial commas:  Chicago Manual of Style, 15th Edition, 2003  Elements of Style, 4th Edition, by Strunk & White, 1972 (reprinted 1999)

New York Times
Wikipedia policy agrees with every notable style manual except the New York Times (which apparently only started printing its manual a few years ago, unlike many others who've been at it for decades or even centuries).

I believe the majority of Wikipedia articles follow the current standard.
Indeed, Oxford commas are very much a better style of list.

SPORTS GIANTS: It's the nickname of 6' 4", 265-lb. Tennessee Titan Jevon Kearse, though we're not sure we'd use it to his face
"The Freak"
He was nicknamed "the Freak" by Southeastern Conference (SEC) opponents during the Gators' 1996 season.
3
Jevon Kearse (born September 3, 1976), nicknamed "The Freak," is an American former football player who was a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL) for eleven seasons during the late 1990s and 2000s.
For all but one month of the season, he was named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Month, and ended up becoming NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year with the help of his rookie record-breaking performance with 14.5 sacks (which led the AFC) that year and forced eight fumbles, which also led the NFL.  He also recorded 57 tackles and he batted away nine passes while also making seven of his tackles for losses.
In 2002, Kearse fractured the fifth metatarsal in his left foot on the second play from scrimmage against the Eagles in the season opener and was inactive for the next 12 games.
QUEEN VICTORIA'S MYSPACE PAGE: Under "heroes" is Louise Lehzen, her governess, who, like her royal house, came from this modern country
Germany
The Times however reported that she was simply visiting friends in Germany.
3
Twentieth century historian Christopher Hibbert describes Lehzen as "a handsome woman, despite her pointed nose and chin, clever, emotional, humourless." At first fearing Lehzen's stern manner, "dear, good Lehzen" soon came to occupy a place in Victoria's heart that superseded all others, including her own mother, the Duchess of Kent.
As Victoria grew older, attempts were made by Conroy and the Duchess for Lehzen's removal, or at least the lessening of her influence.
The same year (in which Victoria turned sixteen), plans to dismiss Lehzen fell apart after she devotedly nursed Victoria through a five-week illness.

Gossip Girl
In 2007, Bell joined the cast of the sci-fi television series Heroes, playing the character Elle Bishop, and the drama series Gossip Girl, as the off-screen titular narrator.

Bell also guest-starred on the HBO drama Deadwood in a two-episode story arc ("Bullock Returns to the Camp" and "Suffer the Little Children").
This was due to additional funding given to director Kyle Newman to shoot new scenes, however, the busy schedules of the actors only allowed for filming in September 2007, thus moving the release date to accommodate that.
Bell has been associated with the idea that "nerdy is the new cool", and she explained, "what was previously perceived as nerdy is now viewed as original.
